"{Introduction}    The phase-field modeling technique involves finding and minimizing the free energy of one or more order parameters that describe a phase {Hohenberg1977,Provatas2010}. The method was originally introduced by Fix in 1983 {Fix1983} and has since been applied to modeling a wide range of problems including material microstructures {Chen2002,Li2017}, crack propagation {Spatschek_2011}, batteries {Wang2020}, biological membranes {Fan_2008}, cellular systems {Nonomura_2012,Palmieri2015} and even immune response {Najem2014}. Some recent advancements  include the phase-field crystal model {Elder2002} and its applications, see e.g., Refs.~{Achim_2006,Emmerich_2011,Faghihi2013,Kocher_2019,Alster2020}, and phase-field damage models {Wu_2017}.   The same field-based approach can also used for problems in which a free energy description is not readily available. In such a case, the equations of motion are, instead, derived phenomenologically. A well-known class of such problems are reaction-diffusion systems, including Turing~{Turing1952} and Gray--Scott models~{Gray_1985}. These exhibit complex morphologies which mimic nature~{Lee_1994,Leppaenen2002,Maini_2012} with far-reaching applications to biological systems~{Murray1989}.  With the phase-field approach gaining popularity, there is a growing need for  open source phase-field simulation software that generalizes some numerical strategies as has been discussed by Hong and Viswanathan~{Hong2020}. Phase-field simulation software can generally be divided between numerical solvers using finite element or finite difference methods. On the finite element side, some recent ones include, e.g., PRISMS-PF {DeWitt2020}, which uses a matrix free approach, as well as SfePy {Cimrman_2019}, FEniCS {Alnaes2015} and MOOSE {Permann2020}, of which the latter offers symbolic algebra functionality and automatic differentiation, allowing for instance, specification of free energy equations. The package FiPy {Guyer2009} is equipped with an accessible Python interface and equation specification.   While there are several packages for the finite element method to solve partial differential equations, much less is available for finite differences.  Current open software includes the Mesoscale Microstructure Simulation Project (MMSP) {Keller2019}, though development appears to have ceased shortly after its release, and  OpenPhase {Tegeler2017}, which employs parallelization and sparse storage  to solve large-scale multi-phase problems.  To improve upon the existing open source tools available using finite difference methods, we develop  extit{SymPhas}{}, an API and software package  that aims at advancing the ability to implement numerical  solutions of general phase-field problems by maximizing accessibility, flexibility and performance.  extit{SymPhas}{} uses a discrete-grid-based approach for the implementation of numerical solvers to allow simulations to scale well with the number of grid points and number of order parameters, regardless of dimension. This is supplemented with parallelization via the C++{} standard library and OpenMP~{Dagum_1998}.  The  extit{SymPhas}{} API allows the user to define and solve any phase-field model that can be formulated field-theoretically, up to three dimensions and with arbitrary numbers of order parameters and equations. This extends to reaction-diffusion problems as well. Phase-field problems are readily specified in the program using the dynamical equations provided in a completely unconstrained form using simple C++{}-macro-based grammar. We achieve this primarily in two ways: 1) Development of a symbolic algebra library to manipulate and transform mathematical constructs as expression trees and 2) a modular approach of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) that progressively layers more complexity as needed by a given application.  The symbolic algebra feature is implemented as compile-time constructs that directly formulate expression trees at the point of definition. This is a unique feature of  extit{SymPhas}{} that is, to the best of our knowledge, not present in any other phase-field software package.   A modular design is used to retain a simple interface for basic uses while simultaneously supporting complex tasks and implementations. This design applies template meta-programming to fully optimize program constructs and eliminate branching wherever possible. We also achieve considerable decoupling between elements, allowing individual functional elements of  extit{SymPhas}{} to remain distinct; this has the added benefit of supporting community development.   The modular approach also facilitates another key feature of  extit{SymPhas}{}: The ability to integrate a user-developed numerical solver into the workflow. The solver is seamlessly integrated via a class inheritance strategy designed to eliminate almost all API-specific restrictions on the solver implementation. In writing the solver, the user can leverage the significant set of features available in the symbolic algebra library and in the  extit{SymPhas}{} API overall.    Through extensive documentation and adherence to best programming practices, we provide  extit{SymPhas}{} as a codebase to be expanded and driven by community development. This is further facilitated by managing the build process with CMake~{cmake}, which provides  extit{SymPhas}{} with multi-platform support and grants users the ability to customize the compilation and installation procedure in a straightforward way.   {Methods}  To generate solutions to phase-field problems, an implementation that defines the problem and establishes the program control flow is written in C++{} using the  extit{SymPhas}{} API. This consists of three components:  {enumerate}    extbf{Model definitions file:} The phase-field description with the equations of motion are specified. These are written using C++{} macros provided by  extit{SymPhas}{} and follow a simple grammar structure. Putting this in a separate file is optional.    extbf{Solver file:} The implementation of a specific method which solves a phase-field problem using the equations of motion.    extbf{Driver file:} Specifies the workflow, data inputs and outputs. {enumerate}  We use OOP  and extensively apply the programming paradigm known as  extit{template meta-programming}; the use of objects and functions defined with arbitrary parameters or data types~{Meyers2005}.  These abstractions are either implicitly (by the compiler) or explicitly (by the user) specialized for concrete types. The benefit of this approach is that the type specialization gives the compiler full information about the call stack, allowing it to make optimizations not possible in different approaches (e.g. virtual inheritance). The other advantage is added extendability through type dependent implementations. The drawback is that since each specialization is unique, the library and executable will take longer to compile and result in a larger size when many specializations are used. For example, compiling five phase-field models of one or two order parameters with one solver defined with all available finite difference stencils -- see Section~ ef{methods:objects:stencils} -- results in a total size of approximately 3MB. As part of template meta-programming, we also apply the  extit{expression template technique}~{Veldhuizen1995,Vandevoorde2003}, commonly referred to as the  extit{curiously recurring template pattern} (CRTP) {Coplien1996}, mainly used in the implementation of the symbolic algebra functionality. A non-exhaustive list of familiar libraries using expression templates includes Armadillo~{Sanderson2016,Sanderson2018}, Blitz++~{Veldhuizen2000}, Boost BLAS~{Schaeling2011}, Dlib~{King2009}, Eigen~{GaeelGuennebaud2010}, Stan Math Library~{Carpenter2015} and xtensor~{xtensor}.    The OOP approach applies a modular design to program structure; this means that we minimize coupling and maximize cohesion~{Vanderfeesten_2008, Candela2016} of all classes in the API, as well as designing each element to support class inheritance or composition. The former is primarily accomplished by following best programming principles such as applying the single-responsibility principle for objects {Martin2002}. The latter implies that objects designed under this modular framework can be readily extended or modified without refactoring the existing code. Moreover, modularity is used to reflect the real world representation of a phase-field problem. The overall aim is to simplify and streamline the future development of  extit{SymPhas}{}.  Additionally, the build process is another aspect designed to be user friendly. Managed by CMake, the user has full control over program definitions and modules. The result of the build process is a shared library that can be linked in a g++ invocation or alternatively, imported into a separate user CMake {cmake} project.  {Overview of Modules}  There are four required and two supplementary modules as part of  extit{SymPhas}{}.  The necessary modules constituting the  extit{SymPhas}{} library are the basic functionality ({lib}), datatypes ({datatypes}), solution ({sol}) and symbolic algebra ({sym}) modules. The module {lib} is a dependency of all other modules, since it introduces components such as objects and types used throughout the program. There are two additional libraries which complete the feature set of  extit{SymPhas}{}: the configuration ({conf}) and the input/output ({io}) modules.  The {datatypes} module depends only on {lib}. It implements objects used in the discrete grid representations, the most important of which is the {Grid} class, a managed array for storing data of 1-, 2- and 3-dimensional problems.  The symbolic algebra library ({sym}) provides the core functionality  to interpret mathematical expressions. The implementation of {sym} contains all the mathematical objects and relations that are required to specify a phase-field equation of motion. It also specifies rules between these objects. The solution module ({sol}) provides the structural and functional framework used to describe and solve a phase-field problem. This is accomplished by defining two objects: One being the programmatic representation of a general phase-field problem and the other which implements a specific set of interface functions for time evolving the phase-field data.    {Objects in  extit{SymPhas}{}} {methods:objects}   The following is a list and brief description of the relevant objects in  extit{SymPhas}{}:  {itemize}   {Grid}: Basic array type for storing phase-field data of arbitrary type.   {Boundary}: Logical element for defining the properties of a grid boundary.   {Stencil}: Object which defines the finite difference stencils used to approximate derivatives in a uniform grid.   {OpExpression}: Interface object representing the node in an expression tree, based on CRTP.   {Solver}: Interface that is specialized for implementing the  solution procedure.   {Model}: Encapsulation of the problem representation, including the equations of motion. Primary interface for managing the solution of a phase-field model. {itemize}  {Uniform Grid}  The data of a grid is initialized in computer memory as a one-dimensional array, and the desired system dimension is logically imposed according to row major order where the first dimension is always the horizontal (-axis). This ensures fastest run time through memory localization.   An extension of {Grid} called {BoundaryGrid} enables the use of finite difference stencils at points near the boundary and implements routines to update boundary grid elements (for example, to apply periodic boundaries). This is accomplished by managing a list of indices that correspond to boundary elements. The number of layers of the boundary is predefined based on the extent of the largest finite difference stencil.  The design of the {Grid} class and any specialization thereof is based on template meta-programming, and allows the user to select the data type and the dimension.   {Finite Difference Stencils} {methods:objects:stencils}   Stencils are finite difference approximations of derivatives of a specified order. In  extit{SymPhas}{}, we implement second and fourth order accurate central-space stencils for various orders of derivatives. To this end, stencils are defined using three characteristics: 1) The order of derivative that is approximated, 2) the order of accuracy, and 3) the dimension of the system. An additional characterization is the number of points used in the approximation. A stencil family is a group of stencils with the same dimension and order of accuracy. We apply this categorization to the design of stencils in  extit{SymPhas}{} by implementing specialized template classes for each family.  Stencils are CRTP-based template classes with member functions for each order of derivative up to fourth order, and a member function for the generalized implementation of higher orders. In particular, the Laplacian, bilaplacian, gradlaplacian and gradient derivatives are explicitly defined according to those derived in {Patra2006}, including both anisotropic- and isotropic-type stencils that are second and fourth order accurate in two dimensions, and second order accurate in three dimensions. Using CRTP in the stencil implementation eliminates branching in the member function invocations; a significant optimization that improves performance since stencils are applied multiple times at each grid point for every solution iteration.   For second order accuracy approximations, the Laplacian is implemented by 5 and 9 point stencils for 2D, and 7, 15, 19, 21 and 27 point stencils in 3D; the gradlaplacian is implemented by 6, 8, 12 and 16 point stencils, and 10, 12, 28, 36 and 40 point stencils in 3D; and the bilaplacian is implemented by 13, 17 and 21 point stencils for 2D, and 21, 25, 41, 52 and 57 point stencils for 3D. For fourth order accuracy approximations, which are only in 2D, the Laplacian is implemented by 9, 17 and 21 point stencils; the gradlaplacian is implemented by 14, 18, 26 and 30 point stencils. The bilaplacian is implemented by 21, 25, 33 and 37 point stencils. The wide selection ensures that appropriate approximations can be used a problem as necessary.   {Expressions} {methods:objects:expression}  One of the primary features of  extit{SymPhas}{} is the symbolic algebra library, which represents mathematical expressions with expression trees formulated at compile time. An expression tree representation allows the equations of motion to be treated as a single object, i.e., they can be persisted as an object state and passed as a function parameter. Moreover, expression trees provide the ability to reorganize and manipulate mathematical expressions.  The symbolic algebra functionality is used to interpret equations of motion that are provided in a general form, and is exposed in a user-friendly way via the  extit{SymPhas}{} API.   Symbolic algebra is implemented in  extit{SymPhas}{} through an approach unique to phase-field simulations programs: CRTP is applied to generate compiled code for an expression tree evaluation so that it is as close as possible to writing the evaluation manually. In this regard, the symbolic algebra is considered ``compile-time constant'', since the expression representation is formulated at compile time. The type name of the CRTP base and expression tree node is {OpExpression}.  One motivation of this design choice is minimizing application runtime, since a design that applies a deterministic control flow to expression tree traversal can significantly increase performance.  The most significant corresponding improvement in performance is the reduction in the time spent by a numerical solver in evaluating the equation of motion of the phase-field model, which takes place for all points in the grid and for each iteration of the solver.  An implication is that, in general, each expression is a unique type (unique CRTP specializations of {OpExpression}).  {Solution Interface}  The base  extit{SymPhas}{} library consisting of the six aforementioned modules does not contain a solver implementation, though two solver implementations that are detailed in Section~ ef{methods:implementation} are provided in the  extit{SymPhas}{} package obtained from Github ({https://github.com/SoftSimu/SymPhas}). Instead, the  extit{solution interface}, {Solver}, declares three functions  which a concrete numerical solver must implement. The solver interface design uses CRTP and is based on applying a mediator design pattern via a special object that we refer to as the ``equation mediator object''. These are generated by the solver for each dynamical equation in a phase-field model before the simulation begins. Its purpose is to recast the equation of motion into a form that can be interpreted by the numerical scheme of the solver in order for the subsequent time index of the corresponding phase-field data to be computed. The equation mediator object is constructed by the solver member function {form_expr_one()}. By taking advantage of the modular framework, we design the solver interface to allow the equation mediator object to remain entirely specific to the implemented solver, maximizing third party development potential. A specialized solver implements the following three primary interface functions, where additional functions, such as derivatives, may also be written as necessitated: {itemize}   {form_expr_one()}: Given the set of equations of motion of a phase-field model, constructs the equation mediator object for a specified equation of motion.  This function is only called once. It performs as much computational work as possible to ensure maximum program performance.   {equation()}: Using the phase-field data and the equation mediator objects, performs an initial time evolution step,  typically writing intermediate results to working memory.   {step()}: Using the phase-field data and intermediate results computed by {equation()}, obtain the next iteration in the solution. {itemize}  {Problem Encapsulation}  To represent the physical phase-field problem in the code domain, objects of basic functionality are successively encapsulated to build necessary functionality. For instance, the {Grid} class is encapsulated by {System} to add information such as the spatial intervals and discretization width. A further encapsulation will specialize {System} into {PhaseFieldSystem}, adding functionality such as data persistence and the ability to populate array values with initial conditions. Using template meta-programming, the {PhaseFieldSystem} object allows the user to select the data type and dimension used for the instantiated type. It also allows encapsulating {Grid} or any of its specializations to modify the basic implementation features as required by the problem or solver.   All of the aspects which constitute a phase-field model are encapsulated in the class {Model}, of which the responsibility is to manage the phase-field data and numerical solver and initialize all phase-field data in a standardized way. It is also the primary interface to the phase-field data and interacting with the solver.  {Model} is itself specialized in order to manage a specific set of equations of motion corresponding to a phase-field problem. The user is responsible for this final specialization through the procedure defined in Section~ ef{methods:capabilities:models}.   {Capabilities} {methods:capabilities}   To produce solutions to  phase-field problems,  extit{SymPhas}{} offers a number of capabilities. These include convenient parameter specification alongside a rich feature set for specifying the equations of motion and managing the phase-field problem. In this section, we briefly list the capabilities relevant in typical use cases and outline the steps for generating a simple driver file in  extit{SymPhas}{}.  {Symbolic Algebra} {methods:capabilities:algebra}  Data are used in the symbolic algebra by linking it with a specialized expression type that represents a ``variable'' term (e.g., in the context of an equation of motion, each order parameter is a ``variable'' linked to the respective phase-field data). The symbolic algebra also defines value literals and spatial derivative operators. Value literals include special constructs representing the positive and negative multiplicative identity (the numbers  and ) and the additive identity (the number ). These are mainly used to facilitate symbolic algebra rules. Some common functions are defined as well, including ,  and the exponential. For less common cases, the convolution operator is also defined. Since the structure of expression trees is managed at compile time, type-based rules defined by specific expression tree structures are applied to formulate expressions, such as when addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations are used. Rules include simplification, distribution, factorization.  While the primary purpose of the symbolic algebra feature is to represent an equation of motion for a phase-field problem and support the user in implementing a specialized solver, the same functionality can be applied in more general applications.  Features such as the ability to name variables and print formatted expressions to an output stream in either simple text or {} format are included. Moreover, the symbolic algebra can be used to perform high-performance pointwise operations on arrays, include new symbols to the algebra ruleset, and even define identities for the new and existing symbols that would be applied automatically.   {Defining New Phase-Field Models} {methods:capabilities:models}   extit{SymPhas}{} provides convenient C++{} macro-based grammar to allow a user to define a new phase-field model in a completely unconstrained way, a novel feature among phase-field simulations software. Each new definition generates a specialization of the {Model} class. Upon recompiling the program, the new model is fully functional without the pitfalls of verbose implementation details. Moreover, the same definition can be interpreted by all solvers available in  extit{SymPhas}{}.  A model is defined in three parts: 1) The model name as it appears in the compilation unit, which must be unique for all models, 2) a list of the order parameters and their types, and 3) the equations of motion. An additional optional section between the order parameter type list and equations of motion can be specified to define virtual variables. These can be used to measure desired system quantities or used in the equations of motion to optimize the runtime by pre-computing values. An example of defining a two-phase model with a virtual variable is demonstrated in Figure~ ef{fig:model_definition}. Specific details including all available macros are offered in the manual.   {figure}               {lstlisting} MODEL(MC,    (SCALAR, SCALAR),   PROVISIONAL_DEF(     (SCALAR),     var(1) = c5 * op(1) * op(2))   MODEL_PREAMBLE_DEF(     ( auto op13 = c2 * op(1) * op(1) * op(1);       auto op23 = c4 * op(2) * op(2) * op(2); )     dop(1) = lap(op(1)) + c1 * op(1) - op13 + lit(2.) * var(1),     dop(2) = -bilap(op(2)) - lap(c3 * op(2) - op23 + c5 * op(1) * op(1))) )     {lstlisting}     {An example of specifying a phase-field model. Model~C~{Hohenberg1977}, which represents eutectic growth with two order parameters~{Elder1994}, is implemented. It is associated with the given name ``{MC}'', which defines the type alias of the model in the code and therefore must be unique. The keywords {op(N)} and {dop(N)} refer to the {N}th order parameter and its time derivative, respectively, and the keyword {var(N)} refers to the {N}th virtual variable. The keyword {SCALAR} specifies that the field types are real-valued. The keyword {lit(v)} is used to represent a numeric constant of value {v} in the symbolic algebra expression. The keywords {lap} and {bilap} apply the 2nd and 4th spatial derivative to their arguments, respectively. The enumerated terms {c1} to {c5} are parameters passed to the model upon instantiation. Variables can be defined before the equations of motion using the macro {MODEL_PREAMBLE_DEF}, demonstrated here with the cubic terms, {op13} and {op23}. This option exists chiefly for convenience and does not affect the structure of the expression tree formulated for the equation of motion. If this section is omitted and only the dynamical equations are provided, then the macro {MODEL_DEF} is used instead.}     {fig:model_definition} {figure}    {Creating Custom Solvers}  The user may develop their own solver using the  extit{SymPhas}{} API and seamlessly integrate it into an existing workflow. Implementation of a solver entails extending the provided {Solver} interface.  A major benefit of the design is provided by the equation mediator object, since it remains completely internal to the functionality of the implemented solver and does not interact with the other parts of the API or program. This allows the solver implementation to be decoupled as much as possible from the surrounding implementation and allows the user to leverage the capabilities of the API without being limited by extensive requisite knowledge.  Additionally, if the built-in {SolverSystem} and its specializations are insufficient, the user may develop a new specialization. This has some constraints and requirements, including following a specific naming style, inheritance requirements and recompilation of the solution module {sol}.    {Standardized Problem Parameter Management}  The parameters of the problem are managed by a specialized object tasked with managing data that fully describes a phase-field problem.  This information includes the initial conditions, the interval data and information about the boundary conditions, the latter which can be specified on an individual basis. There are a number of phase-field initialization routines available to the user, each tuned by user-provided parameters. Initialization routines defined by the user can also be used.   This approach allows the user to have a unified approach to initializing, accessing, and passing problem information, simplifying the workflow and ensuring flexibility.   {Input/Output}  The configuration module provides the user with the ability to write a configuration file with phase-field problem and data persistence parameters, which can be used to construct the problem parameters object.   The  extit{SymPhas}{} API includes data persistence capabilities through the {io} module, which introduces functions and objects for reading and writing phase-field data. The user is also provided with the ability to persist phase-field data at regular checkpoints throughout the simulation, which can later be used to recover simulation data from the last saved point if it is interrupted for any reason. This supports program reliability and convenience, particularly for extended simulations.  Currently, there are three output/input formats: 1) Plain text matrix (the matrix format is amenable to plotting utilities such as gnuplot), 2) plain text column (an ordered list of vectors and values), and 3) binary output in the xdrfile format, popularized by GROMACS {Lindahl2021}. This functionality is available to the user when {io} is compiled with  extit{SymPhas}{} through CMake.   Input can also be given to  extit{SymPhas}{} through the command line; this method allows configuring some program-level parameters. Unlike the configuration file, this a base component of  extit{SymPhas}{}.

The program control flow of the driver file used to to generate the simulations in this paper is illustrated in Figure~ ef{fig:flow}, and is found in the directory {examples/simultaneous-configs} relative to the source code root.  This driver performs several steps, including data persistence, as part of data collection, but a fully functional driver file can be as simple as is written in Figure~ ef{fig:driver_implementation} and included with the source code in {examples/simple-driver}. It is presented here to illustrate relevant  extit{SymPhas}{} API elements, but primarily demonstrate its ease of use.   {Forward Euler Solver} {sec:feuler}  A forward Euler solver is a well-known  explicit numerical method for partial differential equations. It is a first order method and it is known to have instabilities especially when solving stiff systems. It is provided as a base method.  Since it is well-known and taught in virtually every course in numerical methods, we will not discuss it further but refer the reader to one of the standard references such as Press  extit{et al.}~{Press1992}.  {Semi-Implicit Spectral Solver} {sec:spectral}   Consider a phase-field problem for the order parameter ; the equation of motion for this problem may be expressed in the form {equation}  { }{ t} = {L}( abla^{n}) ight + _i{{{N}}_i( abla^{m_i}) f_i() ight},  {eq:spectralphasefield} {equation} where  is a linear combination of derivatives up to order  applied to , and each term in the sum over  is a unique linear differential operator, , of derivatives up to order  that is applied to a nonlinear function .  Under periodic boundary conditions, the semi-implicit Fourier spectral solver approximates the solution to  by first applying the Fourier transform of Equation~( ef{eq:spectralphasefield}): {align}  { {}_{{k}}}{ t} &= {L(k^n)}{}_{{k}} + _i{{N_i}(k^{m_i}) {f}_{i}()_{{k}}}   ,  {eq:phasefieldfourier} {align} where  indicates the Fourier transform of the respective term, ,  is a vector in Fourier space and . Also, since  (and correspondingly ) under a Fourier transform in an infinite domain, the linear operator  becomes the function , a linear combination of the Fourier transformed derivatives, and likewise for .   A difference scheme {Provatas2010} to Equation~( ef{eq:phasefieldfourier}) is determined by solving it as a linear ordinary differential equation and approximating to 1st order, yielding {align}  {}(t +  t)  A{}_{{k}}(t) + B_i N_i(k^{m_i}) {f}_n()_{{k}},  {eq:spectralscheme} {align} where {gather}  A = e^{{L}(k^n) t}   ext{and}  B = {e^{{L}(k^n) t} - 1}{{L}(k^n)}.  {eq:spectraloperators} {gather}  The spectral solver produces Equation~( ef{eq:spectralscheme}) from any given equation of motion, a significant advantage that generalizes the spectral solver to a multitude of problems. This demonstrates the adaptability of the solver and of the program design in general. The spectral solver also computes the values of  and   extit{a priori} to minimize the runtime. The procedure is as follows: {enumerate}   Split the equation into linear and nonlinear parts.  Call the linear part  and the nonlinear part , analogous to the notation in Equation~( ef{eq:spectralphasefield}).   Further split the linear part by separating out terms which do not involve , along with terms that cannot be expressed using a linear operator.   Call the expression formed by these terms  and the expression formed by all other terms . Thus, .   Obtain  by removing  from terms in  and interchanging the derivative terms with the Fourier space transformed derivatives. Generate values for  by evaluating .   Create the new expression  by exchanging all order parameters in  with the Fourier transformed counterparts.     {step:make_D} Let  be represented as the sum of its unique derivatives  applied to expressions , viz.:  {L}_* = _n{d_n  e_n}.    Form the set .     Apply Step~ ef{step:make_D} for the terms of , producing the list . Form the set  where  denotes the Fourier transform of the respective term.       Define the following sets:   {align}    {D}_1 &= (d_n, e_n, e_m)  (d_n, e_n)  {D}_{*}, (d_m, e_m)  {D}_{{N}}, d_n = d_m  ,    {D}_2 &= (d_n, e_n, 0)  (d_n, e_n)  {D}_{*}, (d_m, e_m)  {D}_{{N}}, d_n  ot d_m ,    {D}_3 &= (d_m, 0, e_m)  (d_m, e_m)  {D}_{{N}}, (d_n, e_n)  {D}_{*}, d_m  ot d_n  .  {align}  Define . In other words, generate elements of  by pairing together the expressions in elements from  and  that match based on the derivatives , and if there is no matching derivative in the other set, use 0 in place of the associated expression.     Define two sequences  where  is as defined in Equation~( ef{eq:spectraloperators}) and , using the elements: (d_i, e_{n_i}, e_{m_i})  {D}.  With respect to Equation~( ef{eq:spectralscheme}),  and .   Return the set . {enumerate}  The scheme applied by the implemented spectral solver is then given by: {equation}  {}^{n+1} = A{}^n(t) + _i {B}_i ( {E}^0_i + {E}^1_i  ight), {equation} where  is the approximate solution to   ( for time step ),  and  are the sets of the first and second elements of , respectively, and subscript  represents the indexed elements of their respective sets.    {Simulations and Verification} {sec:results}  Using the semi-implicit spectral solver, we performed simulations of the Allen--Cahn equation (Model A in the Hohenberg--Halperin classification {Hohenberg1977}) describing a non-conserved order parameter  {Allen1975}, the Cahn--Hilliard equation (Model B in the Hohenberg--Halperin classification {Hohenberg1977}) describing a conserved order parameter , and a two order-parameter problem which couples a conserved order parameter  with a non-conserved order parameter  (Model C in the Hohenberg--Halperin classification {Hohenberg1977}). The systems were simulated in both two and three dimensions. Since these systems are well-known and described in literature and since the main goal here is to demonstrate the software, we will not describe the above models in more detail but refer the reader to standard references such as the classic article by Hohenberg and Halperin {Hohenberg1977} and the book by Provatas and Elder {Provatas2010}. We also include a simulation of the phase-field crystal model of Elder et al.~{Elder2002}.   The Allen--Cahn equation describes the dynamics of a non-conserved order parameter  {Hohenberg1977,Provatas2010, Allen1975} as  {equation}         { }{ t} =  abla^2  + c_1 -  c_3^3.         {eq:modelb} {equation} The Cahn--Hilliard equation, on the other hand, describes the phase separation dynamics of a conserved order parameter  {Hohenberg1977,Provatas2010,Cahn1958} as {equation}     { m}{ t} = - abla^4 m -  abla^2 (c_1m - c_2m^3  ight),     {eq:modela} {equation} In addition to these, we simulated a two order parameter problem which couples a conserved order parameter  with a non-conserved order parameter  (Model C~{Hohenberg1977}) through a nonlinear term in the free energy functional: {align}     { }{ t} &=       abla^2  +c_1 - c_2^3 + 2c_5  m     { m}{ t} &= - abla^4 m -  abla^2 (c_3 m - c_4 m^3 + c_5 ^2 ight).     {eq:modelc} {align} This model has been used to describe eutectic growth~{Elder1994}.  The phase-field crystal model was developed to include periodic structure to the standard phase-field free energy functional in order to represent elastic and plastic interactions in a crystal {Elder2002, Elder_2004}. For a conserved density field , the dynamical equation of a phase-field crystal model is given by: {equation}  { n}{ t} =  abla^2( n^2 + n^3 + ((q_0 +  abla^2)^2 -  ight)n  ight). {eq:pfc} {equation}    Coarsening of the phase-field at any point during the transition can be quantified by the radial average of the static structure factor, . The static structure factor, , measures incident scattering in a solid {Lovesey1984, Squires1978}. In the Born approximation for periodic systems,  {Lindgard1994}. The term  is the Fourier transform of , the particle occupancy at the position  in the lattice, which is 1 in the solid phase and 0 elsewhere. Correspondingly, for computing the structure factor of the continuous order parameter field , the positive phase is chosen to represent solidification, that is,  when  and  otherwise.   For both the conserved and non-conserved phase-field models, the radial average of the structure factor should correspond to Porod's law~{Bray_2002}: {equation}     S(k)  (Lk^{d+1})^{-1},     {eq:porodslaw} {equation} where  is the size of the system and  is the dimension.  We use this to establish that  extit{SymPhas}{} generates correct solutions by validating that the relationship holds for  measured from simulations of the Allen--Cahn and Cahn--Hilliard models, representing the non-conserved and conserved dynamics, respectively~{Puri1997}. We proceed by computing  from the average of 10 independent simulations of these models in both 2D and 3D and verifying that the scaling is consistent to Porod's law, Equation~( ef{eq:porodslaw}), for the corresponding dimension.   The implementations of the simulated models with the  extit{SymPhas}{} model definitions macros are provided in Figure~ ef{fig:models_abc_definitions}. As the figure shows, models are defined in a compact and intuitive way.  The initial conditions of models A, B and C are uniformly distributed noise, and the equation parameters , , ,  and  are set to unity. For the phase-field crystal model, 128 randomly arranged seeds containing large fluctuations are initially distributed throughout the system, and the parameters of the equation and simulation were selected from Elder et al.~{Elder2002}. The simulation results for the non-conserved Allen--Cahn model (Model A, Equation~( ef{eq:modela})) are displayed in Figure~ ef{fig:modelab:a} and results for the conserved Cahn--Hilliard model (Model B, Equation~( ef{eq:modela})) are displayed in Figure~ ef{fig:modelab:b}. The structure factor results of these two models are presented in Figure~ ef{fig:model-a_sf} and Figure~ ef{fig:model-b_sf}, respectively.

The performance was measured by the runtime length of the entire program execution, in seconds. Since this includes all program activity between program initialization and termination, the data includes both time spent generating the spectral form and printing the final results to a file. All recorded measurements are listed in Table~ ef{table:performance}, and the details of the hardware platforms are listed in Table~ ef{table:hardware}.  Data was collected by repeating the simulations 10 times. From the system size, it is expected that the second test case is approximately 16 times longer than the first, and the third test case is similar to the second test case, for each model. Additionally, it is expected that Model C results are approximately twice as long as Model A (although the derivatives are of a higher order, and there is a coupling term). The data shows that typically the second test is much longer than the first test, which is the result of the ability for the processor to perform caching on the smaller system. Otherwise, these results correspond well to expectations.   {table}     {Runtime data was recorded for three different hardware and operating system environments, for two models and three different grid sizes. The entries of the table show the results of taking the minimum and maximum runtime values (in seconds) for each individual configuration across 10 individual simulations, in the format ``minimum value/maximum value''.

However, virtual variables used in the equations of motion will be substituted directly as data variables rather than as expression trees, meaning that the expression tree associated with the virtual variable will not be used to construct the expression tree for the equation of motion. One implication of this design is that computing the derivative of a virtual variable that is defined in terms of a derivative will apply a stencil twice, resulting in a poor approximation.  This also means that when using the spectral solver with equations of motion involving virtual variables, the spectral operators may be malformed if a virtual variable is written using a term necessary to correctly construct the operator. Refer to Section~ ef{sec:spectral} which explains the procedure of constructing the operators.  The Euler solver will assume that it can approximate derivatives of any order, but is only able to compute derivatives for which the stencils are implemented. See Section~ ef{methods:objects:stencils} for the exhaustive list of stencils.  Only scalar values can be provided to the model arguments for initializing the values of {c1}, {c2}, , and cannot be other types like matrices or complex types. When the model equations should use other types, then an appropriate number of scalar arguments should be provided in order to construct the term in the model preamble.   {Conclusions}  With  extit{SymPhas}{}, we have developed a high-performance, highly flexible API that allows a user to simulate phase-field problems in a straightforward way. This applies to any phase-field problem which may be formulated field-theoretically, including reaction-diffusion systems. Simulated models are written using the equations of motion in an unconstrained form specified through simple grammar that can interpret mathematical constructs. Here,  extit{SymPhas}{} was tested in both 2- and 3-dimensions against the well-known Cahn--Hilliard~{Cahn1958} and Allen--Cahn~{Allen_1972} models, a model of two coupled equations of motion for eutectic systems~{Elder1994}, and a phase-field crystal model~{Elder2002}. The results demonstrate that  extit{SymPhas}{} produces correct solutions of phase-field problems. Overall,  extit{SymPhas}{} successfully applies a modular design and supports the user by providing individual modules for each functional component alongside a highly detailed documentation.   With the growing interest in phase-field methods outside traditional materials and microstructure modeling, subjects such as wave propagation in cardiac activity and properties of biological tissues are other potential application fields  {Courtemanche_1996, Raina_2015, Gueltekin2016}.  extit{SymPhas}{}  offers very short definition-to-results workflow  facilitating rapid implementation of new models. In addition to being a tool for direct simulations,  extit{SymPhas}{} can generate large volumes of training data for new machine learning simulations of phase-field models. For instance, this type of approach has been applied in recent works that focused on formulating a free energy description from the evolving microstructure {Teichert_2019, Zhang_2020} and in developing machine-guided microstructure evolution models for spinodal decomposition {OcaZapiain2021}.   extit{SymPhas}{} will continue to be developed and have features added over time, which will include items such as upgrades to performance, additional symbolic algebra functionality, stochastic options and more solvers.

"{Experimentation Details}  When { continuing pre-training} BERT-continue/RoBERTa-continue in Table~ ef{tab:continue}, we follow~{kocijan19acl} and set learning rate to , batch size to , and train the model for only one epoch.   When { fine-tuning} the models in Sec~ ef{sec:exp:glue} and Sec~ ef{sec:exp:introduction}, we train the models for  epochs. We use grid search to select their learning rates and batch sizes from  and , respectively.   {Statistics of Commonsense Descriptions} In Table~ ef{tab:stat:wsc} and Table~ ef{tab:stat:glue}, we report statistics about down-stream tasks and their commonsense descriptions. Our report includes the size of the train/test splits for the downstream tasks, the proportion of samples that matched to at least one commonsense description ({ Matched proportion}) in each task, the average number of matched commonsense descriptions per sample ({ Average }), and the average length of each matched commonsense description ({ Average length of }).  From the results, we found that more than half of the samples matched to at least one commonsense description in most of the datasets. This indicates that the OOD commonsense used in this paper is generalizable to different datasets. Also, the average length of the matched commonsense descriptions is short (about ), thus encoding them via Transformer is efficient. {Conclusion}  In this paper, we study how to use commonsense to enhance the general text representation. We first analyzed the challenges brought by the domain discrepancy of commonsense. Then, we propose OK-Transformer to allow commonsense integration and enhancement. In the experiments, we verified the effectiveness of our proposed models in a variety of scenarios, including commonsense reasoning, general text classification, and low-resource commonsense. Our models consistently outperform the baselines. We have also empirically analyzed other properties (e.g. interpretability) of the model.  {Experiments} {sec:exp}  We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed models in three scenarios: cloze-style commonsense reasoning, text classification, and low-resource commonsense settings. All the experiments run over a computer with 4 Nvidia Tesla V100 GPUs.   {table}[]   {Statistical Result on WSC Datasets} {tabular}{lccccc}  oprule[1pt] Dataset               & WSC    & WSCR   & PDP    & WinoGender & WinoGrande   Dataset Size          & 273    & 1185   & 60     & 720        & 40938/1267  matched proportion    & 0.67   & 0.63   & 0.83   & 0.65       & 0.71        Average number of  & 129.71 & 115.42 & 189.68 & 80.63      & 140.56      Average length of  & 17.88  & 17.75  & 17.91  & 16.83      & 17.91    [1pt] {tabular} {table}  {table}[]   {Statistical results on GLUE} {tabular}{lcccccc}  oprule[1pt] Dataset               & MRPC     & CoLA      & RTE      & QNLI        & STS-B     & SST-2       Dataset Size          & 3668/408 & 8551/1043 & 2490/277 & 104743/5463 & 5749/1500 & 67349/872  matched proportion    & 0.59     & 0.40      & 0.72     & 0.52        & 0.56      & 0.25       Average number of  & 80.71    & 84.85     & 122.60   & 81.35       & 117.00    & 83.07      Average length of  & 17.47    & 17.60     & 17.71    & 17.59       & 17.34     & 17.59     [1pt] {tabular} {table}   { Models} We consider adapting OK-Transformer to BERT and RoBERTa, which are denoted as OK-BERT and OK-RoBERTa, respectively. We use the BERT-base and RoBERTa-large from the HuggingFace Transformer library~{wolf2020transformers}.   { Implementation details for candidate knowledge retrieval} For a given text , we retrieve candidate commonsense from ATOMIC2020. We use the if-then descriptions in ATOMIC2020 (e.g. Fig.~ ef{fig:commonsense_list}). Since these descriptions cover 173k different verb phrases -- one of the fundamental elements of language -- the retrieval is applicable to a broad range of downstream text understanding tasks.  We use a simple retrieval method. We simply consider word segments with window size 5 of the input text . All the commonsense descriptions matching one of these text segments will be regarded as the candidate commonsense descriptions .    {Commonsense Reasoning}  {Setup}  { Datasets} We consider the following commonsense reasoning benchmarks: WSC273~{levesque2012winograd}, PDP~{morgenstern2016planning}, Winogender~{rudinger2018gender}, WinoGrande~{sakaguchi2019winogrande}, CommonsenseQA~{talmor2019commonsenseqa} and PhysicalQA~{bisk2020piqa}.   { Model details} Due to the different implementations between {kocijan19acl} and~{sakaguchi2019winogrande}, in this paper, we also follow their settings to compare with them, respectively. For~{kocijan19acl}, we conduct disambiguation tasks directly through masked language modeling in OK-BERT. For the latter one, we convert cloze-style problems to multiple-choice classification problems in OK-RoBERTa. In particular, we replace the target pronoun of one query sentence with each candidate reference, then put the new sentences into the language model. We use a single linear layer and a softmax layer over the encoding of its  token to compute the probability of each new sentence, and select the one with the highest probability as the pronoun disambiguation result.   { Hyperparameters of pre-training} We follow~{kocijan19acl,sakaguchi2019winogrande} to first pre-train models for 30 and 3 epochs over WSCR~{kocijan19acl} or WinoGrande~{sakaguchi2019winogrande}, respectively. Then we fine-tune models over specific tasks. We use AdamW as the optimizer with learning rate 5e-6, which is selected from . We set the batch size to 8.  {table}[!htb]  { abcolsep}{2pt}  {tabular}{l c c}  oprule Model & WSC & PDP   KEE{liu2016commonsense} & 52.8 & 58.3  WKH~{emami2018generalized} & 57.1 & -   MAS~{klein2019attention}  & 60.3  & 68.3   DSSM~{wang2019unsupervised} & 63.0 & 75.0   LM{trinh2018simple} & 63.8 & 70.0    CSS~{klein2020contrastive} & 69.6 & 90.0    GPT2~{radford2019language} & 70.7 & -     BERT-large+WSCR~{kocijan19acl} & 71.4 & 79.2  HNN~{he2019hybrid} & 75.1 & 90.0    Human~{sakaguchi2019winogrande}  & 96.5 & 92.5  BERT+WSCR  & 66.3 & 85.0  { OK-BERT+WSCR }         & { 67.4} & { 86.7 }    RoB.+WinoGrande  & 90.1 & 87.5  { OK-RoB.+WinoGrande } & { 91.6} & { 91.7}   {tabular} {Results on WSC and PDP.

This verifies the effectiveness of our proposed models for commonsense reasoning.  { Ablations} In Table~ ef{tab:main1},~ ef{tab:main2}, and~ ef{tab:main3} we also compare OK-BERT with BERT. We found that OK-BERT with OK-Transformers effectively improved the accuracy of BERT with Transformers. Similar results can be found between OK-RoBERTa and RoBERTa. This shows that the proposed OK-Transformer improves pre-trained language models by adapting to them for free, i.e. without retraining on large-scale unsupervised corpora.  {General Text Classification} {sec:exp:glue} We use MRPC, CoLA, RTE, STS-B, SST-2, and QNLI in the GLUE dataset~{wang2018glue} to verify the effectiveness of the proposed models on general text classification tasks. We did not evaluate over MNLI, because our model needs to represent the corresponding  commonsense for each sentence, which is too costly for MNLI. We believe that this efficiency problem can be solved by further applying model compression~{iandola2020squeezebert}, but this is beyond the scope of this paper. It can be seen from Table~ ef{tab:glue} that OK-BERT and OK-RoBERTa outperform their baselines.   {table*}[!htb]  {     {tabular}{lcccccc}      oprule     GLUE Task       & MRPC & CoLA & RTE & QNLI & STS-B & SST-2       BERT       & 86.27/90.21 &  extbf{59.50} & 71.43 & 91.20 & 89.35/88.93 & 91.97      OK-BERT         &  extbf{87.25/90.84} & 58.29 &  extbf{73.65} &  extbf{91.58} &  extbf{89.82/89.46} &  extbf{93.69}       RoBERTa   & 90.44/93.15 & 66.57 & 84.11 & 94.00 & 91.83/91.95 & 95.70      OK-RoBERTa      &  extbf{91.91/94.24} &  extbf{66.89} &  extbf{86.28} &  extbf{94.41} &  extbf{92.41/92.20} &  extbf{96.10}           {tabular} } {Results on text classification tasks.

However, due to the domain discrepancy of commonsense, this method will cause catastrophic forgetting. To verify this intuition, in this subsection we compare with the continuing pre-trained model. We first continue pre-training the language model over ATOMIC2020, then fine-tune it over the target task.    { ExpBERT}~{murty2020expbert} We also compare our OK-Transformer with ExpBERT, another model that is able to introduce textual knowledge. In Sec~ ef{sec:intro}, we mentioned that ExpBERT is not applicable to large-scale commonsense knowledge bases for its disability to select related commonsense and ignore unrelated commonsense. To verify this, we use the retrieved candidate commonsense descriptions from ATOMIC2020 as the additional explanations for ExpBERT. ExpBERT concatenates all the embedding of a fixed number of commonsense, which is inflexible for ATOMIC2020. For this reason, we fix the number of commonsense to 48. If there are more than 48 candidate commonsense descriptions for one sample, we will randomly select 48 of them. Otherwise, we will pad null commonsense to it. In our experiments, we also apply ExpBERT to RoBERTa~{liu2019roberta} (i.e. ExpRoBERTa).  {table*}[!htb]  {tabular}{lccccccc}  oprule                  & MRPC        & CoLA  & RTE   & QNLI  & STS-B       & SST-2 & WSC273   BERT        & 86.27/90.21 &  extbf{59.50} & 71.43 & 91.20 & 89.35/88.93 & 91.97    & 66.30   BERT-continue & 83.58/88.81         & 54.70  & 62.09 & 90.24 & 87.41/87.46 & 91.74 & 63.00   ExpBERT         & 85.78/89.79 & 58.29 & 62.82 & 87.06 & 84.78/84.67 & 91.51 & --  { OK-BERT}    &  extbf{87.25/90.84} & 58.29 &  extbf{73.65} &  extbf{91.58} &  extbf{89.82/89.46} &  extbf{93.69}  &  extbf{67.40}   RoBERTa    & 90.44/93.15 & 66.57 & 84.11 & 94.00 & 91.83/91.95 & 95.70  & 90.10   RoBERTa-continue  & 87.01/90.38 & 61.74 & 74.01 & 93.61 & 89.57/89.66 & 95.99 & 87.91  ExpRoBERTa      & 89.46/92.22 &  extbf{66.90}  & 83.39 & 93.78 & 89.81/89.94 & 95.99 & --  { OK-RoBERTa} &  extbf{91.91/94.24} & 66.89 &  extbf{86.28} &  extbf{94.41} &  extbf{92.41/92.20} &  extbf{96.10} &  extbf{91.58}   {tabular} {Comparison of different commonsense introduction approaches. Continuing pre-training even injures the effectiveness. On the other hand, using OK-Transformers to introduce external knowledge achieves better results than using Transformer.} {tab:continue} {table*}  We show the results in Table~ ef{tab:continue}. We do not report the results of ExpBERT on WSC273, as ExpBERT cannot solve the cloze-style problems. It can be seen that the performance of language models was suffered when we simply continue pre-training the models on the commonsense knowledge base. This verifies that the continuing pre-training on the out-of-domain commonsense will cause catastrophic forgetting and injure the effectiveness. On the other hand, using OK-Transformer to introduce commonsense as the extra input significantly improves the accuracy. The results also suggest that ExpBERT is not applicable to large-scale commonsense knowledge bases.   {Why is OK-Transformer effective?}  We now analyze why OK-Transformer can effectively introduce out-of-domain commonsense without pre-training. We are inspired by an observation of language model fine-tuning LMs~{radiya2020fine}, i.e., the parameters after fine-tuning are close to those before fine-tuning. Therefore, we argue that the key to effective introduction is whether the parameters of the meta LM is good initialization for the commonsense-enhanced LM, that the parameters do not change much before and after fine-tuning.  To verify this, we compare the parameter changes of different knowledge integration methods. These methods include (1) OK-Transformer, (2) KnowBERT~{peters2019knowledge}, (3) using the original  token instead of the proposed knowledge token, and (4) abandoning the knowledge token and instead calculating the  of each verb phrase of the target sentence separately, and adding them to these verb phrases' hidden states in . We follow~{radiya2020fine} to use the  as the distance metric. {radiya2020fine} found that the main change in parameters occurs on the  matrix of the Transformer. Our experimental results also follow this phenomenon. Therefore, for greater clarity, we only show the distances of the  matrices after fine-tune. We show the distances of different methods in Fig.~ ef{fig:heatmap}, and their training losses in Fig.~ ef{fig:loss}.   {figure}[t]     [scale=.35]{figs/heatmap.pdf} { distances in parameter space between pre-trained and fine-tuned meta LMs. We show the metrics of  across the 12 Transformer layers.} {fig:heatmap} {figure}  {figure}[t]  {minipage}[t]{0.225 extwidth}     *{-} ewline[scale=.42]{figs/loss.pdf}   {Losses of different knowledge integration methods in SST-2.

This fits our intuition of reducing the parameter variations to introduce external knowledge more effectively.    {Effect in Low-Resource Commonsense Settings} Since there is a large number of commonsense descriptions in ATOMIC2020, a large portion of descriptions only occur a few times in the training set. In this subsection, we want to verify for these rare descriptions, can the model still benefit from it? If so, we think it means that the model uses the contextual information of the commonsense to improve the understanding of the commonsense.      To do this, we proposed a low-resource commonsense setting. We evaluate the effect of the model if the training dataset only contains  samples. Therefore the frequency of the appeared commonsense descriptions is low.  In order to exclude the influence of other samples, we only use test samples whose candidate commonsense descriptions have already occurred in the  training samples. For example, when , we randomly select  samples from the training set for training, and use all samples in the test set which contains the commonsense of the  training samples for evaluation. We show the results over the SST-2 dataset in Fig.~ ef{fig:low_resource}. It can be seen that our models still benefit from low-frequency commonsense.         {Comparison of Different Network Structures for Commonsense Enhancement} How to design an effective network structure to incorporate commonsense into text representation is the key problem in this paper. In this subsection, in addition to the layer-by-layer connection and knowledge update mechanism of the knowledge enhancement module in Sec~ ef{sec:knowledge:input}, we compare with other network structures, including: (1) replacing layer-by-layer connection with connecting all s in BERT1 to the final  layer in BERT2 ({ one-to-all}); (2) discard the extra knowledge token  and use  token as the knowledge token instead ({ remove }).  {table}[!htb] { abcolsep}{2.2pt}   {tabular}{@{}lccccc@{}}  oprule & WSC273 & MRPC  & CoLA  & RTE & Average   OK-BERT     & 66.70   & { 87.75} & 59.24 & { 72.20} & { 67.86}  one-to-all & 65.57  & 87.75 & 58.63 & 70.04 & 67.09  remove  & { 67.03}  & 85.04 & { 60.06} & 71.48 & 67.69   {tabular} {Effect of different network structures for commonsense enhancement.} {tab:enhance} {table}  We show the comparisons of these structures in Table~ ef{tab:enhance}. We found using an additional knowledge token  may have competitive results in some datasets, while layer-by-layer connections perform better overall.    {Does OK-Transformer Provide Interpretability?}  In this subsection, we try to answer if the integration of candidate commonsense descriptions by OK-Transformer is interpretable. To answer this question, we calculate the influence of different commonsense descriptions on the model's predictions. We follow~{wu2020perturbed} to quantify the influence of a commonsense description  as: If  is removed from , how much will the prediction change? This change is measured by the Euclidean distance between the prediction by  and by . The greater the change in the prediction, the greater the influence of this commonsense.  {table}[!htb] { abcolsep}{2.2pt}   {tabular}{@{}llll@{}}  oprule {4}{l}{John {promised} Bill to leave, so an hour later {[}John{]} left.}                 {4}{l}{PersonX promises PersonY.}    {4}{l}{1.

We show some examples in Table~ ef{tab:interpret}. We believe that this is because some commonsense for people has been learned in pre-training. Therefore, the out-of-domain commonsense that these pre-trained language models need to incorporate for downstream tasks is inconsistent with human understanding.   {Introduction} {sec:intro} Although unsupervised language models have achieved big success on many tasks~{devlin2018bert}, they are incapable of learning low-frequency knowledge. For example, in the masked language model task in Fig.~ ef{fig:commonsense_list}, even if we replace ``Kevin was'' (left) with ``Jim was'' (right), BERT~{devlin2018bert} still predicts the masked word as sick, crying, dying, etc. This is because similar texts in its training corpus rarely describe the subject of ``comforted''. To improve the model's ability to generalize and understand low-frequency knowledge, we propose to incorporate commonsense into language models. In Fig.~ ef{fig:commonsense_list}, to make correct predictions, we need to enhance the language model with the commonsense .  {figure*}[!htb]     [scale=.5]{figs/example.pdf} {The prediction of [MASK] by BERT. BERT cannot distinguish between { Jim} and { Kevin} in { Jim comforted Kevin because}. } {fig:commonsense_list} {-0.3cm} {figure*}   However, commonsense has the nature of { domain discrepancy}. The downstream task and the commonsense knowledge have distribution discrepancies. Taking the commonsense knowledge base we use (i.e. ATOMIC2020~{hwang2020comet}) as an example, the distribution discrepancy is specifically manifested in (1) their data formats. The format of a commonsense description usually belongs to some specific patterns (e.g. “... As a result ...”, “... Because ...”), while the downstream tasks can have arbitrary patterns. (2) The commonsense belongs to the domain of event causality, while the downstream tasks may belong to arbitrary domains.       Here we highlight the challenges caused by the domain discrepancy. To introduce external textual knowledge to a pre-trained language model, a common practice is to continue pre-training the language model on the corpus of the external knowledge~{gururangan2020don,sun2019finetune}. However, the study~{gururangan2020don} also found that continuing pre-training requires external knowledge and downstream tasks to have similar domains. Due to its domain discrepancy, introducing commonsense through continuing pre-training will cause catastrophic forgetting to downstream tasks, thereby injuring the effectiveness. We have verified this empirically in Sec~ ef{sec:exp:introduction}. Therefore, the domain discrepancy prevents us from introducing commonsense by continuing pre-training.  To enhance the representation of the target text with external commonsense, we propose to directly use its candidate commonsense as an extra input. Our setup is different from a typical natural language understanding setup since the latter one only takes the target text as the input~{devlin2018bert}. We argue that our setup -- where the commonsense is introduced explicitly as input -- is a more practicable setup to introduce out-of-domain commonsense that cannot be learned through pre-training. As far as we know, ExpBERT~{murty2020expbert} is the closest setup to us. It also uses external knowledge (manually constructed templates) as the input.    Another challenge is the { scale} of the commonsense. Although ExpBERT also allows extra textual commonsense as input, it only captures small-scale commonsense with a fixed size. In addition, when we introduce commonsense from a large-scale knowledge base for general purpose (i.e. ATOMIC2020), unrelated commonsense (e.g.  and  in Fig.~ ef{fig:commonsense_list}) will certainly occur. However, ExpBERT lacks the ability to distinguish related and unrelated commonsense. Therefore, the power of large-scale commonsense knowledge was restricted in ExpBERT. We will verify this empirically in Sec~ ef{sec:exp:introduction}.  In order to incorporate the large-scale out-of-domain commonsense, we propose the OK-Transformer ({O}ut-of-domain {K}nowledge enhanced {Transformer}) on the basis of Transformer~{vaswani2017attention}. OK-Transformer has two modules. The knowledge enhancement module is used to encode the target text with commonsense, and the knowledge integration module is used to encode and integrate all candidate commonsense. OK-Transformer has two advantages. First, it fully represents the contextual information of the textual commonsense. Second, it can be adapted to existing pre-trained language models (e.g. BERT and RoBERTa) for free. That is, we are able to adapt OK-Transformer to the pre-trained language models, without pre-training OK-Transformer over large-scale unsupervised corpora from scratch.  Some other methods are related to our work, such as introducing { structured} knowledge~{peters2019knowledge,zhang2019ernie,guan2020knowledge,zhou2018commonsense} and { plain text} knowledge~{guu2020realm} in language models. These methods do not represent the specific inductive bias of commonsense knowledge and therefore are not suitable to introduce commonsense. We will compare these studies with more details in Sec~ ef{sec:related}.    {OK-Transformer}  In this section, we propose OK-Transformer based on Transformer to introduce extra commonsense descriptions. We first show OK-Transformer on an abstract level in Sec~ ef{sec:framework}. Then we elaborate two modules within it, i.e. knowledge enhancement and knowledge integration, in Sec~ ef{sec:knowledge:input} and Sec~ ef{sec:method:output}, respectively.  {Framework} {sec:framework} In this subsection, we show how our OK-Transformer works at an abstract level. For the target sentence , OK-Transformer takes both  and  as inputs. To incorporate all the information of  and , the OK-Transformer contains three vanilla Transformers, denoted by . The knowledge enhancement module uses  to encode the target text. Compared with the vanilla Transformer,  leverages a new knowledge token to represent the commonsense that interacts with other words. The knowledge integration module encodes each individual commonsense description by , and then integrates all candidate commonsense descriptions by . This is shown in Fig.~ ef{fig:ok_transformer}.  {figure}[!tb]     [scale=.45]{figs/ok_transformer_new.pdf} {OK-Transformer.  encodes the target text  with enhanced commonsense .  encodes each individual commonsense description.  integrates all candidate commonsense descriptions and transfers knowledge to .} {fig:ok_transformer} {figure}   {figure}[!htb] {subfigure}[t]{0.45 extwidth}     [scale=.43]{figs/ok_transformer.pdf} {OK-Transformer.  represents the target text  with enhanced commonsense .  represents each individual commonsense description.  integrates all candidate commonsense descriptions and transfers knowledge to .} {fig:ok_transformer} {subfigure} {0.3cm} {subfigure}[t]{0.45 extwidth}      aisebox{3cm}{[scale=.43]{figs/ok_bert.pdf}} {OK-BERT: Adapt OK-Transformer to BERT.

In addition, we introduce a special token  to represent the commonsense knowledge. We denote it as the knowledge token.  encodes all words and the knowledge token together via multi-head attention. Formally, given word sequence ,  accepts a sequence of  word-piece tokens: . We denote the knowledge embedding and word embeddings produced by the -th layer of  as  and , respectively. The  block first uses a multi-head self-attention layer followed by a residual connection and a layer normalization to model their interactions: {equation}  {eqn:kh} {aligned}     & {k_i',{ H}_i'= LayerNorm( [k_{i-1},{ H}_{i-1}] +}       & {MultiHeadAttn([k_{i-1},{ H}_{i-1}],[k_{i-1},{ H}_{i-1}],[k_{i-1},{ H}_{i-1}]))}  {aligned} {equation} where  means appending  at the front of .  is used as the query, key, and value in the multi-head attention.  { Knowledge update} The vanilla Transformer projects  in Eq.~{eqn:kh} to the output space with a multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP). Compared to the vanilla Transformer, we use an extra update operation to update the knowledge token by the integrated commonsense knowledge after the MLP. As in the vanilla Transformer, the update layer is followed by a residual connection and a layer normalization. This can be formulated by: {equation}  {aligned} &{k_{i}=LayerNorm(k_i'+MLP(k_i')+ cs_{emb})}  &{{ H}_{i}=LayerNorm({ H}_{i}'+MLP({ H}_i'))} {aligned} {equation} where  is the embedding of the commonsense computed by the knowledge integration module in Sec~ ef{sec:method:output}.   {Knowledge Integration Module} {sec:method:output} The knowledge integration module encodes all candidate commonsense descriptions and integrates them. We first use  to represent each candidate commonsense description. Then, we use  to integrate all candidate commonsense, and transfer the integrated knowledge to the knowledge enhancement module.    { Representing single commonsense} We use a vanilla Transformer as  to model each candidate commonsense description. For all the retrieved commonsense , we compute the embedding  of each commonsense description  by: {equation}  {emb_j = Transformer^{(2)}(c_j)} {equation}  { Knowledge integration} We integrate all candidate commonsense by . Since not all the candidate commonsense leads to high confidence prediction as we have discussed in Sec~ ef{sec:intro}, we need to select relevant commonsense and ignore irrelevant commonsense. Transformer is adequate to conduct this selection. Specifically, in the query-key-value mechanism in Transformer, we use the embedding of the knowledge token in  as the query of .  and the commonsense embeddings by  as keys and values of . Then, we integrate representations of all different commonsense descriptions based on their similarities with the knowledge token.   also uses multi-head attention to allow the knowledge token to interact with the candidate commonsense in multiple ways. The output of multi-head self-attention is followed by a residual connection and a layer normalization. {equation}  {aligned} {cs_{emb}}= & {LayerNorm(k_{i-1} }  & + {MultiHeadAttn(k_{i-1},{ emb},{ emb}))} {aligned} {equation} where  denotes the sequence of embeddings of all candidate commonsense descriptions. We then apply a residual connection and a layer normalization to it.  { Null Commonsense} Some target texts may not have valid commonsense from ATOMIC2020 to enhance their representations. Therefore, we refer to the settings of REALM~{guu2020realm} to add a null commonsense into the candidate commonsense of all target texts. We denote the null commonsense as . Matching to the null commonsense indicates that the commonsense knowledge base cannot help enhance the target text.  {Adaptation to Pre-trained Language Models} In this section, we take BERT as an example to illustrate how we adapt OK-Transfomer to existing pre-trained language models. We denote the adapted model as OK-BERT. An important manifestation of the effectiveness of the  Transformer structure is its applications in large-scale pre-trained models (e.g. BERT, RoBERTa). In order to introduce external knowledge, many other studies conduct training over large-scale unsupervised corpus~{peters2019knowledge,xiong2019pretrained}. However, OK-Transformer is able to directly adapt to the existing pre-trained language models for free. In other words, when adapting OK-Transformer to OK-BERT, we directly use the parameters of each Transformer layer of BERT to initialize the OK-Transformer layers of OK-BERT. This property greatly improves the applicability of OK-BERT. In the rest of this section, we will describe how , , and  are adapted respectively in Sec~ ef{sec:layer_adapt}, and how to fine-tune OK-BERT in Sec~ ef{sec:train}.  {Layer-by-Layer Adaptation} {sec:layer_adapt} The OK-BERT we designed uses two original BERTs to serve as  and , respectively. We denote them as BERT1 and BERT2. We connect the  and  in the corresponding layer of each BERT by . Therefore, OK-BERT makes full use of the multi-layer structure of BERT, while allowing commonsense in the knowledge token to fully interact with the target text in each layer. The architecture is shown in Fig.~ ef{fig:ok_bert}.  {figure}[!htb]     [scale=.45]{figs/ok_bert2.pdf} {The architecture of OK-BERT. We only draw edges that connect to the -th layer.} {fig:ok_bert} {figure}   We adapt the Transformer of BERT1 to  in the knowledge enhancement module of OK-Transformer. Note that the original BERT's tokens are  (for a single sentence) or  (for a sentence pair). We follow~{wang2020cross} and use a special token  as the knowledge token.  When tokenizing sentences, we insert the  token after the  token for each given text. In this way, the input tokens become  or  , respectively. This simple modification allows us to use  as the knowledge token in the knowledge enhancement module.    We adapt each Transformer layer of BERT2 to the  layer. The adaptation is straightforward since  uses the vanilla Transformer structure. We use the encoding of the  token in each corresponding layer as the commonsense representation  to enhance the representation of the corresponding layer in BERT1.   For each pair of corresponding  and  from the same layer, we use one  to connect them to transfer the information from BERT2 to BERT1.  In summary, when adapting to BERT-base with 12 Transformer layers, OK-BERT contains 12  layers for BERT1, 12  layers for BERT2, and 12  layers for layer-wise knowledge integration.   {Parameter Initialization and Model Training} {sec:train} In our implementation, BERT1 and BERT2 have independent parameters. We use the parameters of BERT to initialize both BERT1 and BERT2. The parameters of  layers are randomly initialized. For downstream tasks, we then fine-tune all the parameters in the fashion of end2end.  {How does OOD Commonsense Help: Explanation from OOD predictions}  {Related work} {sec:related} In this section, we compare different ways to introduce knowledge into language models. We divide the knowledge introduction methods into (1) continuing pre-training method~{gururangan2020don,sun2019finetune} and (2) explicit introduction in the downstream task~{guu2020realm,murty2020expbert}.   { Continuing pre-training} the language model is effective when the external knowledge is similar to the downstream task~{gururangan2020don,sun2019finetune}. However, commonsense and downstream tasks have domain discrepancies, so continuing pre-training is unsuitable for introducing commonsense. We have empirically verified this in Sec~ ef{sec:exp:introduction}.  { Introducing explicit knowledge in downstream tasks} We classify the knowledge into structured knowledge, plain text, and semi-structured knowledge, depending on its form. The entries of { structured knowledge} are represented as individual embeddings~{peters2019knowledge,zhang2019ernie,guan2020knowledge,zhou2018commonsense}, while commonsense descriptions in this paper can be represented more accurately by the contextual information of their word sequences.      {Problem Setup: Commonsense as the Extra Input}  We consider a text classification task where the text  and its label  are provided for training. Assuming that the candidate commonsense descriptions for enhancing  come from a large-scale commonsense knowledge base (i.e. ATOMIC2020), we retrieve candidate commonsense for  as the extra input. We denote the commonsense descriptions for  as , where each  is a commonsense description. The retrieval process will be shown in Sec~ ef{sec:exp}. The model takes both  and  as the input. Since ATOMIC2020 contains if-then knowledge for general purposes, the problem setup can be expanded to a broad range of text understanding tasks. The goal of training is to find parameter  that minimizes the loss of training examples given the texts and candidate commonsense descriptions: {equation}  {eqn:goal} {{}_{ heta} {E}_{(x,y) train} (f(x,cs(x)| heta),y)} {equation} where  is the model taking  and  as inputs,  is the loss function.    op{ {Explanation: Converting OOD Predictions to In-Distribution} {sec:rational}  To illustrate how we use the commonsense to enhance the representation of , we consider the example in Fig.~ ef{fig:commonsense_list}. We want to infer who ``he'' is (Kevin or Jim) from , that is, predicting . Here  and  are both natural language descriptions. This inference requires the joint distribution of  and . We show the corresponding frequency distribution in the training data in Fig.~ ef{fig:sphere}. In our example, this inference is hard if  is OOD in the training dataset.   To avoid directly predicting the OOD data , we introduce the commonsense . Instead of directly inferencing , we use  as the intermediate variable to reduce the difficulty of prediction. We have {equation}  {eqn:yx} {P(y|x)=_z P(y|x,c) P(c|x)} {equation}   In Eq.~{eqn:yx},  can be derived from the commonsense knowledge base. Predicting  rather than  is easier. Since { (crying, keep calm)} has high frequency in the training data, we infer that ``he'' denotes Kevin. Intuitively, the commonsense description  bridge the gap between  and  via the OOD commonsense media .   {figure}[!htb] {subfigure}[b]{0.46 extwidth}     [scale=.5]{figs/intuition2.pdf} {The reference of ``he'' can be inferred if we know the OOD commonsense .} {fig:commonsense_list} {subfigure} {subfigure}[b]{0.46 extwidth}     [scale=.5]{figs/intuition_draw2.pdf} {Distribution of the training dataset. Shallow blue means OOD. Deep blue means ID. With , we convert the OOD prediction  to the ID prediction }     {fig:sphere} {subfigure}  {An example of using OOD commonsense to convert OOD predictions to in-distribution.} {figure}   Note that for some candidate commonsense (e.g. , ), the corresponding  is still OOD. Therefore the model should distinguish different candidate commonsense. This is achieved by the knowledge integration module in Sec~ ef{sec:method:output}. } {Related Work}   { Commonsense reasoning} is considered to be a challenging task in natural language processing~{levesque2012winograd}. With the development of unsupervised language models in recent years~{devlin2018bert,peters2018deep,radford2019language}, people realized that commonsense can be derived from them. For example, {petroni2019language} found that we can extract structured factual knowledge (e.g. ConceptNet~{liu2004conceptnet}) from unsupervised language models. {weir2020existence} found that the unsupervised language model implicitly represents concepts and its associated properties. In some follow-up work, researchers found that language models can be used to solve the task of commonsense-based reference disambiguation. This is also the main task that this paper focuses on.  Zero-shot's commonsense reasoning of unsupervised language models aims to study how to design algorithms to better extract commonsense from unsupervised language models. For example, {trinh2018simple} found that we can use the joint probability of the sentence provided by the language model to determine whether a sentence conforms to commonsense. The author believes that sentences with high joint probability are more in line with commonsense. Therefore, the author completes the disambiguation by replacing the original pronoun with the candidate reference, and using the joint probability as the score of the sentence. Several subsequent works have used similar ideas. {klein2019attention} uses the attention-guided method to calculate the score. {tamborrino2020pre} uses a larger language model Roberta~{liu2019roberta}, and calculates the scores of candidate sentences based on the masked word probability. {shwartz2020unsupervised} provides additional clues for using generative language models (i.e. GPT-2~{radford2019language}) for the target task. These works have achieved good results on some commonsense reasoning tasks.  However, {zellers2019hellaswag} found that the language model is actually looking for sentences that are more in line with lexical cues, rather than sentences that are more in line with commonsense. We agree with the viewpoint of {zellers2019hellaswag}. Since the language model learns and represents the association of the text and its context, this is an inevitable result of a lot of commonsense not being written directly ({gordon2013reporting}). Since the representation learning of the language model is based on data association, it only models ID data, but cannot effectively represent OOD data. We believe that introducing commonsense into the language model is the only way for the language model to understand OOD data. This is also the main research direction of this article.  In contrast to the commonsense reasoning of the zero-shot unsupervised language model, some works believe that the current limitation of commonsense reasoning lies in the lack of relevant training data. Therefore, some data sets similar to common commonsense reasoning were constructed. The earliest data set similar to WSC is WSCR~{rahman2012resolving}. {kocijan19acl} found that if the unsupervised language model is fine-tuning on similar reference disambiguation data sets, the effect of the language model on commonsense-based reference disambiguation can be improved. Therefore, the author constructs MaskedWiki~{kocijan19acl} and WikiCREM~{kocijan2019wikicrem} through masking of Wikipedia data. {sakaguchi2019winogrande} constructed the WinoGrande data set, which has improved WSC in terms of scale and difficulty. Some language models themselves also add such data sets to pre-training corpus. For example, Roberta's pre-training corpus STORIES~{trinh2018simple} is a corpus similar to WSC. These datasets have indeed improved the effectiveness of specific commonsense reasoning tasks.  However, it is clear that the construction of these commonsense data sets is for specific tasks. Its essence is to expand the scope of the model's ID data. But the corpus is always limited. We believe that the introduction of larger data sets cannot solve the OOD problem of more general tasks. We believe that the introduction of task-independent commonsense data is the general way to solve the OOD problem.  { Incorporating External Knowledge into Language Representation Learning}   *{Acknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding} We thank Wenting Ba for her valuable plotting assistance.

To evaluate and reliably compare different methods, we first split our KG into train, test, and validation sets.  More specifically, we sample 55 of all edges for training the link prediction algorithms (where applicable), leaving leave 30 for testing, and 15 for validation.  For each existing pair of occupation and skills node --- which we consider a positive sample in our train, test and validation sets --- we randomly generate a negative sample (i.e., a pair of skills and occupation nodes that do not exist in our KG).  An overview of the number of edges in each set is shown in Table~ ef{tab:train_val_test}.  {table}[!h]  {tabular}{@{}lrr@{}}  oprule                  & Positive & Negative   Training edges   & 2151     & 2151      Validation edges & 586      & 586       Test edges       & 1173     & 1173       Total            & 3910     & 3910       {tabular} [Number of positive and negative edges]{Number of positive and negative edges with a training (55), validation (15), test (30) split } {tab:train_val_test} {table}     {Link Prediction Methods} {Method 1: Preferential Attachment (PA)} {sec:method_pa} The first link prediction method is preferential attachment~{liben2007link}.  This method takes a set of nodes, i.e. node  and node , and calculates a closeness () between two nodes:  {equation} C(u,v) = |(u)|  imes |(v)|, {equation} where  denotes the neighbors of .  A higher score here corresponds to a larger probability the nodes are connected.  The intuition behind this is that if both nodes have a high amount of neighbors the nodes might function as a hub.  Most graphs have the property that hubs have a higher chance to be connected.   To compute all scores, we represent our KG as a matrix, where each node is represented as a row and a column. Note that this matrix is symmetric since the value for row  and column  is equal to the value at row  and column .  At the intersecting cell of two nodes, we store the preferential attachment.  We normalize this matrix by dividing each score by the maximum Closeness score, to ensure that each value is between 0 and 1.  We consider the resulting normalized Closeness score as the probability the corresponding nodes are related.   {Method 2: Node2Vec (N2V)} {sec:method_n2v} The second link prediction method we use is the Node2Vec algorithm~{grover2016node2vec}.  This algorithm can have a number of configurations.  For this paper we use the following parameters:  {itemize}  dimensions = 1024  walk length = 4  number of walks = 2500   (return parameter) = 1    (in-out parameter) = 1 {itemize}  These parameters were selected after a grid search on a large number of possible combinations of parameters.   {Results} Table  ef{tab:F1-results} shows the performance of both Preferential Attachment (PA) and Node2Vec (N2V).  {table}[!h]  {tabular}{@{}llllll@{}}  oprule                                          & class    & precision & recall & f1-score   {2}{*}{PA} & 0.0      &  extbf{0.83}      & 0.64   & 0.72                                              & 1.0      & 0.71      &  extbf{0.87}   &  extbf{0.78}      {2}{*}{N2V}                & 0.0      & 0.66      &  extbf{0.90}   &  extbf{0.76}                                              & 1.0      &  extbf{0.84}      & 0.53   & 0.65      {tabular} [Precision, recall and F1-scores of multiple link prediction algorithms]{Precision, recall and F1-scores of multiple link prediction algorithms with an equal number of positive and negative edges used for training} {tab:F1-results} {table}  When the number of positive and negative edges in the test set is equal, PA outperforms the more complex N2V method, with an f1-score for the positive class of  against .  In most realistic situations however, we may want to explore how a node can be linked to any other node, making the number of comparisons, or edges to predict 1-to-(N-1), i.e., for each node we compare each other node (excluding self).  To approximate this real world performance the ratio of negative to positive edges should reflect these more realistic proportions.  To do so we compute F1-score at increasing ratios of positive-to-negative edges, ranging from 1 (as shown in Table~ ef{tab:F1-results}) to 7.  Results are shown in Figure~ ef{fig:f1-score}. The figure shows that up to ratio of 3:1, N2V is on par with PA, but as ratios increase, N2V outperforms PA, suggesting N2V is better suited for most real world situations.    {figure}[!h]  [width=]{figs/f1-score_v2} [Comparison of Node2Vec and Preferential Attachment]{Comparison of Node2Vec and Preferential Attachment for different ratio's negative edges / positive edges} {fig:f1-score} {figure}   {Analysis} Now that it has been established that N2V is more suitable for our task, we aim to employ this algorithm to predict the relationships between occupations and skills.  When doing so we need to realize that the graph which we use as input is imperfect in terms of correctness and completeness~{paulheim2017knowledge}.   Looking at the false positives of the algorithm, skills that are --- according to our dataset --- incorrectly linked to occupations can be identified.  For KG completion, we aim to identify those skills that are not linked to occupations, but should be.  Table~ ef{tab:example_node2vec} shows a random sample of False Positives: it reinforces our intuition that link prediction can be employed for KG completion, as some of the predicted edges make sense, e.g., the skill: ``preparing materials for dental procedures'' is shown as a relevant skill for the occupation: ``dentist.'' By consulting domain experts, skills can be efficiently added to enrich the current graph.   {table*}[t]  {tabular}{@{}lll@{}}  oprule ISCO-Code & Occupation & Predicted Skill   1341  & Child care services managers  & children's physical development  2261  & Dentists  & prepare materials for dental procedures  3251  & Dental assistants and therapists  & dentistry science  4110  & General office clerks  & demonstrate professional attitude to clients  5411  & Fire fighters  & safety engineering  6121  & Livestock and dairy producers  & promote animal welfare  7132  & Spray painters and varnishers  & spray pesticides  8344  & Lifting truck operators  & hazardous materials transportation  9111  & Domestic cleaners and helpers  & provide lawn care   {tabular} {False positives: edges predicted by N2V that do not exist in our KG} {tab:example_node2vec} {table*}  To further explore these intuitions, in Figure~ ef{fig:tb} we show the edges to skill nodes predicted by N2V, for the node representing ISCO code 2611: ``Lawyers.''  The y-axis shows skills edges, and the x-axes show the link prediction probabilities, for all predictions with a probability0.5 (i.e., positive predictions by the method).  The green bars denote True Positives (i.e., correctly predicted edges between the skill and occupation), and blue bars depict False Positives (skills that are predicted to have an edge with the occupation, but do not exist in our KG). % The figure shows ``education law'' and ``investigation research methods'' as newly identified skills for lawyers, not found in the original ESCO taxonomy nor in co-occurrences in job postings.   {figure}[h]  [width = ]{figs/lawyer} [Predictions of the Node2Vec algorithm]{Predictions of the Node2Vec algorithm for ISCO group  (Lawyers)} {fig:tb} {figure}  {Skills-based Occupation Similarity} To determine the feasibility of an occupation transfer, we propose to model the distance between occupations with Jaccard distance.  We compute Jaccard distances between occupations by representing each occupation as the set of its required skills (which we extract from our KG), and computing the overlap between two sets of skills.  See Figure for an illustration~ ef{fig:jaccard}.  {figure}[h]  [width = 0.6]{figs/jac_graph} [Jaccard distance in a graph]{Jaccard distance in a graph where nodes A, B are occupations and nodes C, D, E, F are skills. Solid lines denote direct connections, dashed lines denote Jaccard distance.} {fig:jaccard} {figure}  In our KG a total of  links can be made between pairs of skills and pairs of occupations.  From these pairs  is between skills and  between occupations.  To gain insight in the overall similarity of skills and occupations, we study the distribution of jaccard distances in Figure~ ef{fig:jaccard_dist}.  {figure}[!h]  [width = ]{figs/jaccard_2} [Distribution of the jaccard distance ]{Distribution of the jaccard distance where the orange color represents the skills and the blue color represent the occupations} {fig:jaccard_dist} {figure}  Looking at the distribution of Jaccard distance one can see that on average, skills are more similar to one another than occupations.  This becomes apparent when looking at the mean value of both distributions: for occupations the mean is , and for skills around .  Over 99 of occupations have a Jaccard distance between 0.8 and 1, meaning that occupations require distinct skillsets.  Both distributions are skewed to the left, meaning that the mean (average of the observations) is left of the mode (most observed value).   In the distribution we see a number of spikes, which can be explained by the prevalence of some fractions over others, e.g., if half of the neighbors are shared, the Jaccard distance will be , which can be achieved in a number of different ways.  Other spikes occur at additional common fractions such as  and .    {table}[!h] {tabular}{@{}lrrr@{}}  oprule       & Skill  & Occupation & Total    count & 107959 & 12993      & 120952  mean  & 0.825  & 0.938      & 0.837   std   & 0.163  & 0.070      & 0.160   min   & 0.000  & 0.000      & 0.000   25  & 0.800  & 0.928      & 0.800   50  & 0.875  & 0.960      & 0.888   75  & 0.923  & 0.977      & 0.933   max   & 0.985  & 0.993      & 0.993    {tabular} {Statistics of the jaccard distribution} {tab:jacard_distibution} {table}  In Table  ef{tab:jacard_distibution} we show a description of the distance distributions.  For both skills and occupations the minimum distance is 0, meaning that a skill is shared by every occupation where the skill is connected to or that two occupations share every skill.  An example is  extit{``Food service counter attendants''} and  extit{``Hotel receptionists,''} both share the same skillset and thus have a Jaccard distance of 0.  Skills with a distance of 0 are for example  extit{``Lop trees''} and  extit{``Pruning techniques.''}  The highest distance found in the dataset is , this corresponds with the occupations  extit{``Electronics engineers''} and  extit{``Policy administration professionals.''}  They share at least one skill but are --- next to the shared skill --- completely different.  The common skill in this example is  extit{``perform project management.''}   {Career Pathfinding using Dijkstra's algorithm} With the distances between each occupation and between skills, we can proceed to identify the most efficient transition between every pair of occupations.  This is done by assigning the Jaccard distance scores as edge weights between nodes in our graph, to enable computational methods for finding the most efficient path between a start node (the current occupation) and an end node (the desired occupation).  We show an example of such a transition in Figure~ ef{fig:path_example}: here we set a threshold for the maximum possible distance at . This threshold was determined to be optimal based on eye-balling and comparing a different cutoff points. If two occupations are further apart than  we consider the step too large.   {figure}[h]  [width=0.5 ]{figs/transition.pdf} [Example of distance between occupations]{Distance between the occupations . Black lines denote distances lower than . Red lines denote distances higher than .} {fig:path_example} {figure}  In this example we start at node  and want to go to node .  We are not able to directly transition between  and  because the occupations are not similar enough ().   {Method} Finding the most efficient path in an undirected weighted graph can be done by applying shortest path algorithms.  For this paper we turn to Dijkstra's algorithm~{dijkstra1959note}, because of its proven speed and widespread availability of implementations.  According to Dijkstra's algorithm, the shortest allowed path between  and  in Figure~ ef{fig:path_example} is via node .   We show a real world example in Figure~ ef{fig:covid_example}.  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic a lot of people find themselves out of a job, especially individuals that work in restaurants.  Using the described model we can calculate which occupation has the smallest distance to the occupation: ``cook.''  Dijkstra's algorithm yields ``bakers, pastry-cooks and confectionery makers'' as most feasible transition.   {figure}[h]  [width=1]{figs/Cooks.PNG} [The shortest path between occupations]{The shortest path between the occupation ``Cook'' and the closest connected occupation, in this case ``Bakers, pastry-cooks and confectionery makers.''} {fig:covid_example} {figure}    {Problem Statement}{sec:PS}  To facilitate candidate to job posting matching, it is important to know which skills are relevant, in demand, and in supply.  Here, the need for a flexible data representation for skills arises.  This representation should facilitate various tasks, such as a skills similarity metric to be able to quantify likeliness between skills, skills-to-occupation similarity metrics, to help people navigate the labor market and find new occupations, and understanding which skills relate to which occupations to inform which skills are needed for desired occupations.  And since relations between skills and occupations are not static and need robust and accurate updating methods to ensure the information does not get outdated.    In this paper we address the task of skills and occupation graph construction which we describe in Section~ ef{chap:datapreperation}, and apply this data representation to the following set of use-cases:  link prediction for identifying novel skills-occupation relations in Section~ ef{chap:RQ1},  skills-based occupational similarity for career pathfinding in Section~ ef{chap:RQ2}, and  identifying distinctive skills per occupational group for learning  development in Section~ ef{chap:RQ3}.  {Method} The two criteria described above fit naturally to the Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) weighting scheme for terms~{schutze2008introduction}.  This statistic is chosen as it directly models the desired criteria described in the previous section, more specifically, TF-IDF is used to assign weights to words in a corpus of documents, where a word is deemed more important if it (i) is observed frequently within the document but (ii) not frequently across different documents in the corpus.   {equation}  TF-IDF(t,d) = tf_{t,d}  imes ({N}{df_{t} + 1}), {equation} where  denotes the Term Frequency of  in ,  denotes the number of documents containing , and  denotes the total number of documents in the corpus.  We ``transplant'' this TF-IDF weighting scheme from terms in documents to skills associated to occupations.  TF-IDF consists of two parts:  Term Frequency (TF) is the frequency of a word (skill) used in a given document (observed with an occupation),  Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) is a way to discount highly common terms, i.e., it is high when a word (skill) appears in a smaller number of documents (observed with a low number of occupations).  Common terms (skills) will thus yield a lower IDF score.   For our TF-IDF-based model, we consider skills identified in job postings terms, and documents can be modeled as a collection of job postings belonging to an ISCO group.  The counts of skills, which model term frequency, correspond to the number of times a skill is found in a job posting associated to a certain ISCO code.    {Results and analysis} {Level 1 ISCO groups} The resulting score provides us with skills that are common for a given occupation (group) but uncommon in all other occupation(s) (groups).  Table~ ef{tab:skill_relevance} shows the top 5 skills for the level 1 ISCO groups.   In this table  extit{Microsoft Office} appears both in the  extit{Managers} and  extit{Clerical support workers} groups. For this skill to score high in multiple contexts (occupation groups) the frequencies need to be substantial in both, to be able to compensate for the IDF component of the metric.  In the Managers group,  extit{Microsoft Office} has a TF of 9 and in  extit{Clerical support workers} a TF of 5.   {Multiple ISCO levels} ISCO level 1 helps us to understand which skills are relevant for the least granular level; to deepen our understanding we look at the development of multiple layers of ISCO group 2 in Figure~ ef{fig:skill_relevance}. Here, we show the 3 most relevant skills for several ISCO levels of the ``Professionals'' ISCO group.  We notice the following: First, communication-related skills appear in multiple forms across occupation groups.  The terms  extit{communication},  extit{communication sciences},  extit{communication studies},  extit{ICT communication protocols},  extit{manage online communications} and  extit{communication disorders} seem to be closely related.  Because these skills are defined as distinct skills, each skill receives its own ranking. This concept can appear multiple times.   Next, ``Nursing professionals'' and ``Nursing and midwifery professionals'' share the same set of relevant skills, which are highly similar to those of their parent group ``Health professionals''. Skills that appear in those groups are the most frequent skills in the parent group.    Finally, the further down the figure we go, the more specialized the skills appear to be, and more specialized skills, such as ``dental studies,'' are more commonly observed in level 4 ISCO groups. A possible explanation for this is that specialized skills do only appear at specialized occupations.      {figure}  [width=]{figs/skill_relevance} {Three most relevant skills for multiple levels in major ISCO group 2} {fig:skill_relevance} {figure}   {table*}[]  esizebox{ extwidth}{!}{{tabular}{@{}ll|l|l@{}}  oprule   & Managers & Professionals & Technicians and associate professionals   1 & Microsoft Office & Network Marketing & Marker Making  2 & Service-oriented Modelling & Manage Online Communications & Electronic Communication  3 & Communication Principles & Communication & Service-oriented Modelling  4 & Electronic Communication & Explain Accounting Records & Education Administration  5 & Coordinate Patrols & Accounting & Manage Standard ERP System     & Clerical support workers & Service and sales workers & Skilled agricultural, forestry and fishery workers   1 & Execute Administration & Security Panels & Leadership Principles  2 & Perform Clerical Duties & Electronic Communication & Agricultural Information Systems and Databases  3 & Microsoft Office & Create Solutions to Problems & Pruning Techniques  4 & Education Administration & Execute Administration & Spray Pesticides  5 & Human Resource Management & Recreation Activities & Lop Trees     & Craft and related trades workers & Plant and machine operators, and assemblers & Elementary occupations   1 & Attend to Detail in Casting Processes & Mechatronics & Inventory Management Rules   2 & Attention to Detail & Mechanical Engineering & Have Computer Literacy  3 & Adobe Illustrator & Electrical Engineering & Carpentry  4 & Adobe Photoshop & Operate Soldering Equipment & Place Concrete Forms  5 & ML (computer programming) & Act Reliably & Operate on-board Computer Systems   {tabular}} {Five most relevant skills per major ISCO group based in the TF-IDF matric} {tab:skill_relevance} {table*}     {Occupations (ISCO) and skills (ESCO)} The first step involves constructing a shared Skills  Occupational Knowledge Graph, through combining the existing ISCO and ESCO taxonomies.   {ISCO (occupations)} The International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) is ordered as a taxonomy of occupational groups with four granularity levels across ten different major groups.  An occupation is defined as  extit{``a set of jobs whose main tasks and duties are characterized by a high degree of similarity''}, where a job is defined as  extit{``a set of tasks and duties performed, or meant to be performed, by one person, including for an employer or in self-employment.''~{ilo}} Take, for example: the occupation ``computer programmer,'' which is defined by the level 4 ISCO code: 2132.  The occupation then belongs to the the level 3 group ``computing professionals'' (ISCO-code 213), which in turn belongs the level 2 group ``computing, engineering and science professionals'' (ISCO-code 21), which, finally, falls in the level 1 group ``professionals'' (ISCO-code 2).   {table}[h]  {tabular}{@{}ll@{}}  oprule Group Number & Major Group Name                                     1            & Managers                                            2            & Professional                                        3            & Technicians and associate professionals             4            & Clerical support workers                            5            & Service and sales workers                           6            & Skilled agricultural, forestry and fishery workers  7            & Craft and related trades workers                    8            & Plant and machine operators, and assemblers         9            & Elementary occupations                              10           & Armed forces occupations                             {tabular} {The 10 major job groups of the ISCO-08} {tab:isco} {table}    {ESCO (skills)} We define our initial high-level occupation groups by using the ISCO standard. For skills, we turn to The European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations (ESCO) taxonomy~{ESCO}.  ESCO defines a skill as follows:  {description} [Skill]  extit{``the ability to apply knowledge and use know-how to complete tasks and solve problems''} {description}  The ESCO covers 13,485 skills, connected to 2,942 occupations (in 27 languages).   We link our ISCO occupations to ESCO by using the direct links that are defined between ISCO level 4 groups (most fine-grained/lowest level of the taxonomy) and ESCO concepts, in the ESCO.  These links between ESCO and ISCO are not (necessarily) 1-to-1, as multiple ESCO occupations can be linked to a single (level 4) ISCO group.   In Figure~ ef{fig:TheStructureOfTheOccupationsPillar} we illustrate this connection between ISCO and ESCO.  ESCO occupations are shown in blue, with ISCO occupation groups in purple.  In addition to the ESCO occupations shown in the image, ESCO also defines skills (not shown), e.g., the ESCO occupation ``Cattle breeder,'' has skills linked to them such as ``feed livestock'' and ``assist animal birth.''   {figure}[t]  [width=1.0]{figs/TheStructureOfTheOccupationsPillar.PNG} {The structure of the occupations pillar {ESCO}} {fig:TheStructureOfTheOccupationsPillar} {figure}   {KG enrichment through job posting data} Now that we have our high-level KG structure based on ISCO and ESCO, which defines occupations and skills as nodes, and edges as links between ESCO and ISCO objects, we turn to job posting data to account for the dynamic nature of associations between skills and occupations, as described in Section~ ef{sec:introduction}.  To make sure our KG reflects the current status of the labor market, we use information from job postings to enrich the structure of our KG.  More specifically, we create additional edges by identifying and extracting ESCO skills for each job posting's ISCO occupation group, and assign weights to edges by relying on co-occurrence statistics of skills and occupations.   This second step of our process revolves around extracting skills from job postings.  We describe our job posting dataset in Section  ef{Vacancy Parser}, our approach for skill extraction in Section  ef{Vacancy Parser}, and how we match extracted skills to ESCO skills in~ ef{Skill Matching}.        {Vacancy data}{Vacancy data} Our vacancy dataset consists of sample of 600,000 Dutch vacancies collected by Jobdigger~{Jobdigger}, each job posting is labeled with a level 4 ISCO code.  Our sample was chosen by selecting a uniform distribution of ISCO level 1 occupations, to make sure our set covers the entire breadth of the labor market.  Prior to sampling our set at the ISCO level 1, the initial dataset was cleaned by discarding low quality and noisy job postings, such as postings that represented multiple occupations, or job postings that contained a low number of sentences. Here, we treat vacancy data as a proxy for the demand in the job market. By doing so, internal promotions and career paths and informal channels are not taken into account.   {Skill Extraction}{Vacancy Parser} For skill extraction we rely on the % industry-standard Textkernel Extract~{TextKernel} parser.  For each vacancy text, Textkernel Extract returns a json object with corresponding skills, represented by the surface form identified in the job posting (skill mention), a unique identifier representing the skill (skill id), and finally, a confidence score that quantifies the likelihood of the extracted skill to be correct.  {Skill Matching}{Skill Matching}  Given the skills extracted by Textkernel, we match them to the skill nodes in our KG, by relying on the surface forms of the skills (skill mentions). More specifically, we leverage character -grams Jaccard similarity between the normalized skill mention and the normalized ESCO skill names.  We set the similarity threshold to , which was empirically determined to be optimal using a smaller set of our  Textkernel skills to ESCO skill-mappings.  The high-level process is shown in Figure~ ef{fig:skill_match_flow}.  {figure}[t] [width = 0.8]{figs/skill_match_flow} [Overview of skill matching process]{Overview of skill matching process} {fig:skill_match_flow} {figure}  {Final Skills  Occupational Knowledge Graph} Our final KG, resulting from the process shown in Figure~ ef{fig:flow} and described in the previous section, consists of 1,220 nodes, of which 983 represent (ESCO) skills, and 237 (ISCO) occupations.  These nodes are connected through  edges, with an average node degree of .   This KG is a subset of the full ESCO ( skills), and ISCO ( occupations) taxonomies.  There are several reasons why our KG is a subset and does not span the entirety of the ISCO and ESCO taxonomies.  First, it is conceivable that not all ISCO occupations are in current demand, e.g., we found that there were no vacancies for ISCO occupation code 8111: ``mining-plant operators,'' which is not surprising with currently no mines in operation in The Netherlands.  Next, it is likely we are dealing with coverage issues, from (i) the likely incomplete coverage of the TextKernel Extract method we use for skill extraction, and  (ii) our skills matching methodology further reducing the number of identified skills.  As the focus of this paper is on downstream applications, we consider matching out of scope, and rely on our naive but solid character -grams-based

"{GAN-based Abstraction}{sec:abstraction}  {Model Abstraction}  The underlying idea is the following: given a stochastic process  with transition probabilities , we aim at finding another stochastic process whose trajectories are faster to simulate but similar to the original ones. Time has to be discretized, meaning we fix an initial time  and a time step  that suits our problem. We define , . In addition,  given a fixed time horizon , we define time-bounded trajectories as . Given a state  and a set of parameters , we can represent a trajectory of length  as a realization of a random variable over the state space . The probability distribution for such random variable is given by the product of the transition probabilities at each time step:  . The CTMC, , is now expressed as a time-homogeneous Discrete Time Markov Chain .  An additional approximation has to be made: the abstract model takes values in , a continuous space in which the state space  is embedded. In constructing the approximate probability distribution for trajectories we can decide to restrict our attention to arbitrary aspects of the process, rather than trying to preserve the full behavior. A {projection}  from  to an arbitrary space  can be used to reach this purpose,  for instance, to monitor the number of molecules belonging to a certain subset of chemical species, i.e., .  Note that  is a random variable over .  Such flexibility could be extremely helpful in capturing the dynamics of systems in which some species are not observable.  {Abstraction accuracy.} Another important ingredient is a meaningful quantification of the error introduced by the abstraction procedure, i.e., the reconstruction accuracy. Such quantification must be based on a distance, , among distributions.  We choose the Wasserstein distance, together with the absolute and relative difference among means and variances of the histograms. Given a distribution over initial states  and a distribution over parameters , we would like to measure the expected error at every time instant  with . Formally, we want to measure  where  denotes the -th time components of the projected trajectory .  To estimate such quantity we use a well-known unbiased estimator, which is the average over the distances computed over a large sample set of  initial settings. Computing the distance among SSA and abstract distributions at each time step quantifies how small the expected error is and, more importantly,  how it evolves in time. As a matter of fact, it shows whether the error tends to propagate or not and how much each species contributes to the abstraction error.  In practice, we compute  distances among distributions over  as we want to know how each species contributes in the reconstruction error.   {-0.2cm}  {Dataset Generation}  {Training set.}  Choose a set of  initial settings and for each setting simulate  SSA trajectory of length . The training set is composed of  pairs initial setting-trajectory, i.e. pairs  for  and .  {Test set.}   Choose a set of  initial settings and for each setting simulate a large number, , of SSA trajectory of length . The test set is composed of  pairs initial setting-trajectory, i.e. pairs  for  and .   {Partial observability.} In case of partial observability, ,  we fix an initial condition for species in , and simulate a pool of trajectories each time sampling the initial value of species in . As a result, we are learning and abstract distribution that marginalizes over unobserved variables.  {-0.2cm}  {cWCGAN-GP architecture}   The critic  takes as input a batch of initial states, , a batch of parameters, , and a batch of subsequent trajectories, . For each  the inputs, ,  and , are concatenated to form an input with dimension . Formally, .  To enforce the Lipschitz property over  we add a gradient penalty term over . Samples of  are generated by sampling uniformly along straight lines connecting points coming from a batch of real trajectories and points coming from a batch of generated trajectories.  On the other hand, the generator  takes as input a batch of initial states, , a batch of parameters, , and a batch of random noise, , with dimension , a user-defined hyper-parameter. For each  the two inputs are, once again, concatenated to form an input with dimension . The generator outputs a batch of generated trajectories . Formally, , such that . See the pseudocode for the algorithm in Appendix~ ef{sec:algorithm} of [XXX].  {-0.2cm}  {Model Training} The cWCGAN-GP-based model abstraction framework consists in training two different CNNs. The loss function, introduced in Eq.~{eq:wassdist_gp}, is a parametric function depending both on the generator weights  and the critic weights .  When training the critic, we keep the generator weights constant , and we maximize  w.r.t. .   Formally, we solve the problem  {equation*}        w_c^* = {w_c}{{argmax}}{L}(w_c, {w}_g).  {equation*} On the other hand, in training the generator, we keep the critic weights constant ,  and we minimize  w.r.t. .  Formally, we solve the problem  {equation*}          w_g^* = {w_g}{{argmin}} {L}({w}_c,w_g) =  {w_g}{{argmin}}   -{E}_{z,(s_0, heta)}[C_{{w}_c}(G_{w_g}(z,s_0, heta),s_0, heta)]. {equation*} As mentioned in Section  ef{sec:background}, the loss function derives from the Wasserstein distance between the real and generated distributions, see {arjovsky2017wasserstein,gulrajani2017improved} for the mathematical details.  Intuitively, the generator generates a batch of samples, and these, along with real examples from the dataset, are provided to the critic, which is then updated to get better at estimating the distance between the real and the abstract distribution. The generator is then updated based on scores obtained by the generated samples from the critic. An important collateral advantage is that WGANs have a loss function that correlates with the quality of generated examples.  Training the cWCGAN-GP has a cost. Nonetheless, once it has been trained, its evaluation is extremely fast. Details about training and evaluation costs are discussed in Section~ ef{sec:experiments}.     {Abstract Model Simulation.} Once the training is over, we can discard the critic and focus only on the trained generator . In order to generate an abstract trajectory starting from a state  with parameters , we just have to sample a value  from the random noise variable  and evaluate the generator on the pair . The output is a stochastic trajectory of length : . The stochasticity is provided by the random noise variable, de facto the generator acts as a distribution transformer that maps a simple random variable  into a complex distribution. In order to generate a pool of  trajectories, we simply sample  different values from the random noise variable: . Therefore, the generation of a trajectory has a fixed computational cost.  {Case Studies}{sec:casestudies} {itemize}   extbf{SIR Model (Absorbing state).}  The SIR epidemiological model describes a population divided in three mutually exclusive groups: susceptible (S), infected (I) and recovered (R). The system state at time  is . The possible reactions, given by the interaction of individuals (representing the molecules of a CRN), are the following: {itemize}       (infection),        (recovery). {itemize} The model describes the spread, in a population, of an infectious disease that grants immunity to those who recover from it. As the SIR model is well-known and stable, we use it as a testing ground for our GAN-based abstraction procedure. The ranges for the initial state are . An important aspect of the SIR model is the presence of an absorbing states. In fact, when  or when  no more reaction can take place.     extbf{Ergodic SIRS Model.} Small perturbations of the SIR model force the system to be ergodic. We called this revised version ergodic SIRS (eSIRS). This model has no absorbing state. In particular, we assume that the population is not perfectly isolated, meaning there is always a chance of getting infected from some external individuals. In addition, we also assume that immunity is only temporary. The possible reactions are now the following: {itemize}       (infection),        (recovery),        (immunity loss), {itemize} Both epidemiological models are essentially unimodal. The ranges for the initial state are  such that . In our experiments .

For each model, we present a small batch of trajectories, both real and abstract (plots on the left column). From the plots of such trajectories we can appreciate if the abstract trajectories are similar to real ones and if they capture the most important macroscopic behaviors. We also show the histograms of the empirical distributions at time  for each species (plots on the right column) to quantify the behavior over all the K trajectories present in the test set.

In order to do so, we can resort to formal languages, such as Signal Temporal Logic (STL) {maler2004monitoring}. The first step is to express formally the property that we would like abstract trajectories to preserve. Then we can measure the satisfaction probability of such property for both real and abstract trajectories and check if it is similar on a large pool of initial settings. Examples are shown in Fig.  ef{fig:satisf}. For the e-SIRS model we consider the property ``eventually the number of infected remains below a threshold of 25 individual"". For abstract trajectories of the SIR model we check, for each test point, the percentage of valid trajectories, i.e. such that the state  is absorbing. Finally,  for the Toggle Switch model we check the property ``eventually the level of protein  stays above a threshold of "", meaning we check for each test point the percentage of SSA and abstract trajectories that satisfy such property. It can be written as . These comparisons produce a measurable qualitative estimate of how good the reconstruction is. As future work, we intend to use such qualitative measure as a query strategy for an active learning approach, so that the obtained abstract model is driven in the desired direction.    {Statistical tests}{sec:stat_test} {figure}[ht]          [scale=0.245]{imgs/SIR/SIR_pvalues_no_rescaled_Energy.png}     [scale=0.245]{imgs/eSIRS/eSIRS_pvalues_no_rescaled_Energy.png}     [scale=0.245]{imgs/TS/ToggleSwitch_pvalues_no_rescaled_Energy.png}     [scale=0.245]{imgs/Oscillator/Oscillator_pvalues_no_rescaled_Energy.png}     [scale=0.245]{imgs/MAPK/MAPK_pvalues_no_rescaled_Energy_1500epochs.png}     {Average over the initial setting of the p-values (with confidence interval) for each species computing by the two-sample statistical test w.r.t. the number of samples present in the empirical distributions.}     {fig:stat_test} {figure} In this section we show the results of a two-sample statistical test over all the cases studies. In particular, we use a statistical test based on the energy distance among distributions {szekely2013energy}. For each initial setting and for each species we compute the distance statistics and the p-value among the empirical approximation of the SSA distribution and the empirical approximation of the abstract distribution over the trajectory space, i.e. a -dimensional space. In Fig.  ef{fig:stat_test} we report the mean and the standard deviation of p-values over the initial settings present in the test set. Clearly the p-value decreases as the number of samples used to approximate the distributions increases. Fig.  ef{fig:stat_test} shows how the p-values for each species varies according to the number of samples used. These results come with no surprise as the abstract model was trained having only  observations for each initial setting. It is interesting to observe how the Energy test is passed by a large percentage of points when the number of samples is around . In order to enhance the resilience of the abstract model to such statistical tests we should increase the number of samples per point in the training set. This comes at the cost of reducing the number of initial setting, so that the resulting training set is not too large. In this regard, the active learning technique proposed in Section  ef{sec:satisf} can be extremely beneficial.  {cWCGAN-GP Algorithm}{sec:algorithm}   {algorithm}[ht]   {The gradient penalty coefficient , the number of epochs , the number of critic iterations per generator iteration , the batch size , Adam hyper-parameters .}  {}{   {}{   {}{         Sample real data , latent variable , a random number                                               }         {          Adam          }    }    {    Sample a batch of latent variables and a batch of random conditions      Adam     }        {}  }  {Conditional WGAN with gradient penalty.

Under the well-stirred assumption, the time evolution can be modelled as a Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC) on a discrete state space.  The vector  denotes the state vector at time , where  is the number of individuals in species  at time . The dynamics is encoded by a set of  reactions with parametric propensity functions that depends on the state of the system. Due to the memoryless property of CTMC,  the probability of finding the system in state  at time  given that it was in state  at time  can be expressed as a system of ODEs known as Chemical Master Equation (CME). Since in general the CME is a system with countably many differential equations, its analytic or numeric solution is almost always unfeasible. An alternative computational approach is to generate trajectories using stochastic algorithms for simulation, like the well-known Gillespie’s SSA~{gillespie1977exact} which produces statistically correct trajectories, i.e., sampled according to the stochastic process described by the CME.  {-0.2cm}  {Generative Adversarial Nets}{sec:gan_intro}  Every dataset can be considered as a set of observations drawn from an unknown distribution . Generative models aim at learning a model that mimics this unknown distribution as closely as possible, i.e., learn a distribution  as similar as possible to , in order to then get samples from it that are new but look as if they could have belonged to the original dataset. Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs)~{goodfellow2014generative} are deep learning-based generative models, that, given a dataset, are capable of generating new random but plausible examples.   {Wasserstein GAN.} In this work we consider the Wasserstein version of GAN (WGAN)~{arjovsky2017wasserstein,gulrajani2017improved} as it is known to be more stable and less sensitive to the choice of model architecture and hyperparameters compared to a traditional GAN. WGANs use the Wasserstein distance (also known as Earth-Mover's distance), rather than the Jensen Shannon divergence, to measure the difference between the model distribution  and the target distribution . Because of  Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality {villani2008optimal} such distance can be computed as the supremum over all the 1-Lipschitz functions : {equation}{eq:wassdist}   W({P}_r,{P}_{w_g}) =  _{||f||_L 1} ( {E}_{x{P}_{r}}[f(x)]-{E}_{x{P}_{w_g}}[f(x)]  ight). {equation} We approximate these functions  with a neural net  parametrized by weights .  To enforce the Lipschitz constraint we follow {gulrajani2017improved} and introduce a penalty over the norm of the gradients. It is known that a differentiable function is 1-Lipchitz if and only if it has gradients with norm at most 1 everywhere.  The objective function, to be maximized w.r.t. , becomes: {equation}{eq:wassdist_gp}   {L}({w_c}, w_g) := {E}_{x{P}_{r}}[C_{w_c}(x)]-{E}_{x{P}_{w_g}}[C_{w_c}(x)]- {E}_{{x}{P}_{{x}}} (   abla_{{x}}C_{w_c} ({x})  _2-1 )^2]  , {equation} where  is the penalty coefficient and  is defined by sampling uniformly along straight lines between pairs of points sampled from  and . This is actually a softer constraint that however performs well in practice~{gulrajani2017improved}. The  network is referred to as  extit{critic} and it outputs different scores for real and fake samples, its objective function (Eq.~{eq:wassdist_gp}) provide an estimate of the Wasserstein distance among the two distributions. On the other hand, the distribution  is parametrized by ; we seek the parameters that make it as close as possible to . To achieve this, we consider a random variable  with a fixed simple distribution  and pass it through a parametric function, the  extit{generator},  that generates samples following the distribution . Therefore, the WGAN architecture consists of two deep neural nets, a generator that proposes a distribution and a critic that estimate the distance between the proposed and the real (unknown) distribution. Using WGAN brings several important advantages compared to traditional GAN: it avoids the mode collapse problem, which makes WGAN more suitable for capturing stochastic dynamics, it drastically reduces the problem of vanishing gradients and it also have an objective function that correlates with the quality of generated samples, making the results easier to interpret.   {Conditional GAN.} Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets (cGAN)~{mirza2014conditional} are a type of GANs that involves the conditional generation of examples, i.e., the generator produces examples of a required type, e.g. examples that belong to a certain class, and thus they introduce control over the desired generated output. In our application, we want the generation of stochastic trajectories to be conditioned on some model parameters and on the initial state of the system.  Furthermore, dealing with inputs that are trajectories, i.e. sequences of fixed length, requires the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs)~{goodfellow2016deep} for both the generator and the critic.  The architecture used in this work is thus a conditional Wasserstein Convolutional GAN with gradient penalty, it is going to be referred to as cWCGAN-GP.   {Experimental Results}{sec:experiments}  In this section we validate our GAN-based model abstraction procedure on the following case studies. More details  are provided in Appendix~ ef{sec:casestudies}. {itemize}       extbf{SIR Model (Absorbing state).}  The SIR epidemiological model describes the spread, in a population, of an infectious disease that grants immunity to those who recover from it.

The output signal shows either stable or oscillating behaviour, depending on the input signal.  {itemize}   In order to evaluate the performance of our abstraction procedure we consider two important measures: the accuracy of the abstract model, evaluated for each species at each time step of the time grid, and the computational gain compared to SSA simulation time.   {Experimental Settings.}  The workflow can be divided in steps: (1) define a CRN model, (2) generate the synthetic datasets via SSA simulation, (3) learn the abstract model by training the cWCGAN-GP and, finally, (4) evaluate such abstraction. All the steps have been implemented in Python.  In particular, CRN models are defined in the  exttt{.psc} format, CRN trajectories are simulated using Stochpy~{maarleveld2013stochpy} (stochastic modeling in Python) and PyTorch~{paszke2017automatic} is used to craft the desired architecture for the cWCGAN-GP and to evaluate the latter on the test data. All the experiments were performed on a  Intel Xeon Gold 6140 with 24 cores and a 128GB RAM. The source code for all the experiments can be found at the following link: {https://github.com/francescacairoli/WGAN_ModelAbstraction}.    {Datasets.} For each case study with fixed parameters, the training set consists of K different SSA trajectories. In particular, K and .  The test set, instead, consists of  new initial settings  and from each of these we simulate K trajectories, so to obtain an empirical approximation of the distribution targeted by model abstraction. When a parameter is allowed to vary, the training set consists of K SSA trajectories (K and ).  We manually choose  and  so that the system is close to steady state at time , without spending there too many steps. The time interval should be small enough to capture the full transient behavior of the system. For systems with no steady state, such as the oscillating models, we choose  and  so to observe a full period of oscillation. The chosen values are the following: SIR: , ; e-SIRS: , ; Toggle Switch: , ; Oscillator: , ; MAPK: , .  {Data Preparation.}  Data have been scaled to the interval  to enhance the performance of the two CNNs and to avoid sensitivity to different scales in species counts. During the evaluation phase, the trajectories have been scaled back. Hence, results and errors are shown in the original scale.  {-0.2cm}  {cWCGAN-GP architecture}  The same architecture and the same set of hyper-parameters works well for all the analyzed case studies, showing great stability and usability of the proposed solution. The Wasserstein formulation of GANs, with gradient penalty , strongly contributes to such stability. Traditional GANs have been tested as well, but they do not have such strength. The details of the archictecture follows the best practice suggestions provided in~{gulrajani2017improved}.  The critic network has two hidden one-dimensional convolutional layers, with  channels, each containing  filters of size  and stride . We use a leaky-ReLU activation function with slope , we do layer normalization and at each layer we introduce a dropout with probability . An additional dense layer, with linear activation function, is used to connect the single output node, that contains the critic value. In order to enforce the Lipschitz constraint on the critic’s model we add a gradient penalty term, as described in Section~ ef{sec:gan_intro}. On the other hand, the generator network takes as input the noise and the initial settings and it embeds the inputs in a larger space with  channels ( in our experiments) through a dense layer. Four one-dimensional convolutional transpose layers are then inserted, containing respectively , ,  and  filters of size  with stride . Here we do batch normalization and use a leaky-ReLU activation function with slope . Finally, a traditional convolutional layer is introduced to reduce the number of output channels to .  The Adam algorithm~{bengio2015rmsprop} is used to optimize loss function of both the critic and the generator. The learning rate is set to  and . The above settings are shared by all the case studies, the only exception is the more complex MAPK model for which a deeper cWCGAN-GP architecture is selected: a critic with five layers, each containing  filters of size  and stride , and a generator with five layers, containing respectively , , ,  and  filters of size  with stride .  Training times depend on the dimension of the dataset, on the size of mini-batches, on the number of species, and on the architecture of the cWCGAN-GP. The latter has been kept constant for all the case studies. Batches of  samples have been used and the number of epochs varies from  to  depending on the complexity of the model. Moreover, each training iteration of the generator correspond to  iterations of the critic, to balance the power of the two player. The average time required for each training epoch is around one minute.  Therefore, training the cWCGAN-GP model for  epochs takes around  hours leveraging the GPU.  {-0.2cm}  {Results}  {Computational gain.} The time needed to generate abstract trajectories does not depend on the complexity of the original system. Moreover, as the cWCGAN-GP architecture is shared by all the case studies, the computational time required to generate abstract trajectories is the same for all the case studies. In particular, considering a noise variable of size , it takes around  milliseconds (ms) to simulate a single trajectory. However, when generating batches of at least 200 trajectories the overhead reduces and the time to generate a single trajectory stabilizes around 0.8 ms. The same does not hold for the SSA trajectories, whose computational costs depends on the complexity of the model and on the chosen reaction rates. In the case studies considered the time required to simulate a single trajectory varies from  to  seconds, but it easily increases for more complex models or for smaller reaction rates, whereas the cost of abstract simulation stays constant. Details about the computational gain for each model are presented in Table~ ef{table:comp_times}. Computations are performed exclusively on a single CPU processor, to perform a fair comparison. However, the evaluation of cWCGAN-GP can be further sped up using GPUs, especially for large batches of trajectories, but this would have introduced a bias in their favour. It is important to stress how GPU parallelization is extremely straightforward in PyTorch and how the time to generate a single trajectory decrease to 1.9  seconds when generating a batch of at least  trajectories (see last line of Table~ ef{table:comp_times}).  The training phase introduces a fixed overhead that affects the overall computational gain. For instance, the training phase of the MAPK model takes around 8 hours, which is equivalent to the time needed to generate 140K SSA trajectories. It follows that, together with the trajectories needed to generate the training set, the cost of the training procedure is paid off when we simulate at least 200K trajectories. In a typical biological multi-scale scenario in which we seek to simulate the evolution in time of a tissue containing millions of cells, having additional internal pathways, the number of trajectories needed for the training phase becomes negligible and the training time is soon paid off.  {table}  {Measures of performance.} Results are presented as follows. For each model, we present a small batch of trajectories, both real and abstract. From the plots of such trajectories we can appreciate if the abstract trajectories are similar to real ones and if they capture the most important macroscopic behaviors. We also show the histograms of empirical distributions at time  for each species to quantify the behavior over all the K trajectories present in the test set (see Fig.~ ef{fig:sir_trajectories}-~ ef{fig:mapk_trajectories}). Additional plots are shown in Appendix~ ef{sec:plots} (Fig.~ ef{fig:sir_trajectories_extra}-~ ef{fig:clock_trajectories_extra}).     {figure}[ht]          [eSIRS]{   [scale=0.235]{imgs/eSIRS/eSIRS_avg_wass_distance_1000epochs_32steps.png}}              [eSIRS-1P]{       [scale=0.235]{imgs/eSIRS_1P/Scaled_avg_wass_distance_1epochs_32steps.png}}              [SIR]{       [scale=0.235]{imgs/SIR/Scaled_avg_wass_distance_500epochs_16steps.png}}          {-0.25cm}          [Oscillator]{       [scale=0.235]{imgs/Oscillator/Oscillator_avg_wass_distance_1000epochs_32steps.png}}              [Toggle Switch]{       [scale=0.235]{imgs/TS/ToggleSwitch_avg_wass_distance_2000epochs_32steps.png}}              [MAPK]{       [scale=0.235]{imgs/MAPK/MAPK_avg_wass_distance_1500epochs_32steps_scaling.png}}  {-1}  {Plots of the error over time for each model and each species. Errors are computed using the Wasserstein distance over the entire test set. Generated trajectories have been keep scaled to the interval  so that the scale of the system does not affect the scale of the error measure.{-0.5cm}}{fig:wass_errors} {figure}  {Measuring error propagation.} The reconstruction accuracy of the proposed abstraction procedure is performed on test sets consisting of  different initial settings. For each of these points K SSA trajectories represent the empirical approximation of the true distribution over .  From each of these initial settings we also simulate K abstract trajectories. Given a species  and a time step , we have the real one-dimensional distribution  and the generated abstract distribution , where  denotes the counts of species  at time  in a trajectory . In order to quantify the reconstruction error, we compute five quantities: the Wasserstein distance among the two one-dimensional distributions, the absolute and relative difference among the two means and the absolute and relative difference among the two variances. By doing so, we are capable of seeing whether the error propagates in time and whether some species are harder to reconstruct than others. The error plots for the Wasserstein distance are shown in Figure~ ef{fig:wass_errors}. Plots of means and variances distances are provided in Appendix~ ef{sec:plots} (Fig.~ ef{fig:avg_means_errors}-~ ef{fig:avg_vars_rel_errors}). In addition, for two-dimensional models, i.e. eSIRS, Toggle Switch and MAPK, we show the landscapes of these five measures of the reconstruction error at three different time steps: step , step  and step  (Fig.~ ef{fig:eSIRS_distance_landscapes}- ef{fig:mapk_distance_landscapes} in Appendix~ ef{sec:plots}).  We observe that, in all the models, each species seems to contribute equally to the global error and, in general, the error stays constant w.r.t. time, i.e., it does not propagate. This was a major concern in previous methods, based on the abstraction of transition kernels.  In fact, in order to simulate a trajectory of length  the abstract kernel has to be applied iteratively  times. As a consequence, this results in a propagation of the error introduced in the approximation of the transition kernel.   {figure}[ht]               [scale=0.25]{imgs/SIR/SIR_Trajectories14.png}     [scale=0.25]{imgs/SIR/SIR_hist_comparison_last_timestep_14.png}          {-1}          {SIR     model:  extbf{(left)} comparison of trajectories generated with a cWCGAN-GP (orange) and the trajectories generated with the SSA algorithm (blue);  extbf{(right)} comparison of the real and generated histogram at the last timestep.

Each point is represented by three trajectories, the top one is for species S, the central one is for species I and the bottom one is for species R. The population size, given by , is variable. The abstraction was trained on a dataset with fixed parameters, . Likewise, in the test set only the initial states are allowed to vary. We observe that our abstraction method is able to capture the absorbing nature of SIR trajectories. It is indeed very important that once state  or state  are reached, the system should not escape from it. Abstract trajectories satisfy such property without requiring the imposition of any additional constraint. The empirical distributions, real and generated, at time  are almost indistinguishable.   extbf{e-SIRS.} The e-SIRS model represents our baseline. We train two abstractions: in the first case the model is trained on a dataset with fixed parameters, , and in the second case we let parameter  vary as well. Results are very accurate in both scenarios In the fixed-parameters case, Fig.~ ef{fig:esir_trajectories} (Appendix~ ef{sec:plots}), the results are shown for two, randomly chosen, initial states. In the second case, Fig.~ ef{fig:esir_trajectories_one_par}, the results are shown on two, randomly chosen, pairs . Each point is represented by a pair of trajectories, the top one is for species S and the bottom one is for species I. We performed a further analysis on the generalization capabilities of the abstraction learned on the dataset with one varying parameter, using larger test sets and computing mean and standard deviation of the distribution of Wasserstein distances over such sets. The mean stays around  with a tight standard deviation ranges from  to , showing little impact of the chosen conditional setting (see Fig.~ ef{fig:esirs_1p_analysis} in Appendix~ ef{sec:plots}).   extbf{Toggle Switch.} The results for the Toggle Switch model, on two, randomly chosen, test points, are shown in Fig.~ ef{fig:ts_trajectories}) and Fig.~ ef{fig:ts_trajectories_extra} (Appendix~ ef{sec:plots}). The abstraction was trained on a dataset with fixed symmetric parameters ( for ). Likewise, in the test set only the initial states are allowed to vary. In this model, we tried to abstract only trajectories of the proteins  and , which are typically the observable species, ignoring the state of the genes. By doing so, we reduce the dimensionality of the problem but we also lose some information about the full state of the system. Nonetheless, the cWCGAN-GP abstraction is capable of capturing the bistable behaviour of such trajectories. In Fig.~ ef{fig:ts_trajectories}, each point is represented by two trajectories, the top one is for species , whereas the bottom one is for species .     extbf{Oscillator.} The results for the Oscillator model, on two, randomly chosen, test points, are shown in Fig.~ ef{fig:clock_trajectories} and Fig.~ ef{fig:clock_trajectories_extra} (Appendix~ ef{sec:plots}). The abstraction was trained on a dataset with fixed parameter (). Likewise, in the test set only the initial states are allowed to vary. Each point is represented by three trajectories, the top one is for species , the central one is for species  and the bottom one is for species . The abstract trajectories well capture the oscillating behaviour of the system.    extbf{MAPK.} The results for the MAPK model, on three, randomly chosen, test points, are shown in Fig.~ ef{fig:mapk_trajectories}. The abstraction was trained on a dataset considering only a varying  parameter and the dynamics of species .  This case study represents a complex scenario in which the abstract distribution should capture the marginalization over the other seven unobserved variables. Moreover, the emergent behaviour of the only observed variable, , is strongly influenced by the input parameter  and further  amplified by the multi-scale nature of the cascade: for some values of  the system oscillates, whereas for others it stabilizes around an equilibrium. Results show that our abstraction technique is flexible enough to capture such sensitivity.  {-0.2cm}  {Discussion} Previous approaches to model abstraction, see Related work in Section~ ef{sec:introduction}, focus on approximating the transition kernel, meaning the distribution of possible next states after a time , rather than learning the distribution of full trajectories of length . The main reason for such choice is the limited scalability of the tool used for learning the abstraction. In fact, learning a distribution over  with a Mixture Density Network is unfeasible even for small . Moreover, in learning to approximate the transition kernel one must split the SSA trajectories of the dataset in pairs of subsequent states. By doing so, a lot of information about the temporal correlation among states is lost. Having a tool strong and stable enough to learn distributions over  allows us to preserve this information and make abstraction possible even for systems with a complex dynamics, which the abstraction of the transition kernel was failing to capture. For instance, we are now able to abstract the transient behaviour of multi-stable or oscillating systems. When attempting to abstract the transition kernel, either via MDN or via c-GAN, for such complex systems, we did not succeed in learning meaningful solutions. A collateral advantage in generating full trajectories, rather than single subsequent states, is that it introduces an additional computational speed-up in the time required to generate a large pool of trajectories of length . For instance, if a cWGAN is used to approximate the transition kernel, it takes around  seconds to simulate the K trajectories of length  present in the test set. Our trajectory-based method takes only  seconds to generate the same number of trajectories. Furthermore, our cWCGAN-GP was trained with relative small datasets, which leaves room for further improvements where needed. An additional strength of our method is that one can train the abstract model only on species that are observable, reducing the complexity of the CRN model while preserving an accurate reconstruction for the species of interest. Once again, this was not possible with transition kernels and it may be extremely useful in real world applications.  In general, the cWCGAN-GP approximation does not provide any statistical guarantee about the reconstruction error. In addition, the set of observations used to learn the abstraction is rather small, typically  samples for each initial setting. Therefore, it is not surprising that the real and the abstract distributions are not indistinguishable from a statistical point of view, as shown in Appendix~ ef{sec:stat_test}. However, the abstract model is actually capable of capturing, from the little amount of information provided, the emergent features of the behaviour of the original system, such as multimodality or oscillations.  In this regard, formal languages can be used to formalize and check such qualitative properties. In particular, we can check whether the satisfaction probability (of non rare events) is similar in real and abstract trajectories. Examples are shown in Appendix~ ef{sec:satisf}. Furthermore, such quantification of qualitative properties can be used to measure how good the reconstruction is. As future work, we intend to use it as query strategy for an active learning approach, so that the obtained abstract model is driven in the desired direction.    {Introduction}{sec:introduction}  A wide range of complex systems can be modeled as a network of chemical reactions. Stochastic simulation is typically the only feasible analysis approach that scales in a computationally tractable manner with the increase in system size, as it avoids the explicit construction of the state space. The well known Gillespie Stochastic Simulation Algorithm~{gillespie1977exact} is widely used for simulating models, as it  samples from the exact distribution over trajectories. This algorithm is  effective to simulate systems of moderate complexity, but it does not scale well to systems with many species and reactions, large populations, or internal stiffness. In these scenarios, a more effective choice is to rely on approximate simulation algorithms such as tau-leaping~{cao2006efficient} and hybrid simulation~{pahle2009biochemical}.  Nonetheless, when the  number of simulations required is extremely large and possibly costly, e.g. when one needs to simulate a large population of heterogeneous cells in a multi-scale model of a tissue or to simulate many heterogeneous individuals in an population ecology scenario,  all these methods become extremely computationally demanding, even for HPC facilities.   A viable approach to address such problem is model abstraction, which aims at reducing the underlying complexity of the model, and thus reduce its simulation cost. However, building effective model abstractions is difficult, requiring a lot of ingenuity and man power. Here we advocate the strategy of learning an abstraction from simulation data. Our strategy is to frame model abstraction as a supervised learning problem, and learn an abstract probabilistic model using state of the art deep learning. The probabilistic model should then be able to generate approximate trajectories efficiently and in constant time, i.e., independent on the complexity of the original system, thus sensibly reducing the simulation cost. {Related work.} The idea of using machine learning as a model abstraction tool to approximate and simplify the dynamics of a Markov Population Process has received some attention in recent years.  In~{bortolussi2018deep} the authors use a Mixture Density Network (MDN)~{bishop2006pattern} to approximate the transition kernel of the stochastic process. In~{petrov2020automated} the authors extend the previous approach by introducing an automated search of the MDN architecture that better fit the data. In~{bortolussi2019bayesian} the authors present a Bayesian model abstraction technique, based on Dirichlet Processes, that allows  the quantification of the reconstruction uncertainty. In all cases, what is learned is an approximate transition kernel,  i.e., the probabilistic distribution of a single simulation step.   In this paper we address a more general and more complex problem. Instead of learning an approximate transition kernel, we learn the distribution of an entire trajectory of fixed length. This latter problem is not solvable with any of the previously adopted approaches, and its major goal is to keep abstraction error under control. In fact, training the abstract model on a full trajectory, rather than on pairs of subsequent states, allows the abstract model to retain and capture more information about the dynamics of the Markov process.  {Contributions.} Our approach leverages Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN), which are one of the most strong and flexible techniques to learn probabilistic models. In fact, the GAN-based model abstraction technique is capable of learning a conditional distribution over the trajectory space, keeping into account the correlation, both spatial and temporal, among all the different species and conditioning both on initial states and model parameters. All the previous approaches focus on learning the distribution of the state of the system after a time , the so called  extit{transition kernel}. However, such approaches perform poorly when the time interval is small and the dynamics is transient, showing a clear propagation of the error as the approximate kernel is applied iteratively to form a trajectory.  Furthermore, producing a full trajectory reduces even more the computational cost of simulating a large pool of trajectories for different initial settings.   {Paper structure.} The paper is organized as follows: in Section~ ef{sec:background} the relevant background notions are introduced, in Section~ ef{sec:abstraction} we describe in detail the abstraction procedure, Section~ ef{sec:experiments} presents the case studies and the experimental evaluation. Conclusions are drawn in Section~ ef{sec:conclusions}.  {Conclusions}{sec:conclusions} In the paper we presented a technique to abstract the simulation process of stochastic trajectories for various CRNs. The WGAN-based abstraction improves considerably the computational efficiency, which is no more related to the complexity of the underlying CRN.  This would be extremely helpful in all those applications in which a large number of simulations is required, i.e., applications whose solution is unfeasible via SSA simulation. It would enable the simulation of multi-scale models for very large populations, it would speed-up statistical model checking {younes2006statistical} and it can be used in particular cases of parameter estimation, for example when only few parameters have to be estimated multiple times. In conclusion, the c-WCGAN-based solution to model abstraction perform well in scenarios that are very complex and challenging, requiring relatively little data and very little fine-tuning.  As future work, we plan to study how our abstraction technique works on real data. In this regard, we do not aim at capturing the underlying dynamical system, but we would rather be able to reproduce the trajectories observed in real applications.  A great strength of our method, compared to state of the art solutions, is that it is able to generate trajectories only for a subset of the species present in the system domain, ignoring the information that is not observable, even during the training phase. Another interesting extension is to adapt our technique to sample bridging trajectories, where both the initial and the terminal states are fixed. Typically, the simulation of such trajectories requires expensive Monte Carlo simulations, which makes clear the benefits of resorting to model abstraction.  {   oindent extbf{Acknowledgements} This

"{{sec:Intro}Introduction}  oindent In a He gas discharge, two long-lived, excited (``metastable'') atomic levels are formed by electron-impact excitation from the S electronic ground level: the S level (electronic energy eV {NIST_ASD}, natural lifetime s {Hodgman2009}) and the S level (eV {NIST_ASD}, ms {VanDyck1971}). In the following, the metastable He atoms are referred to as spin-polarized, when only a single magnetic sub-level of He(S) is populated. Such spin-polarized metastable He (He) is used for a wide range of applications. Special interest is currently devoted to He magnetometry for the quantum sensing of very small magnetic fields, e.g. see Refs.{Heil2017, Wang2020}. In metastable atom electron spectroscopy {Harada1997}, also referred to as metastable de-excitation spectroscopy, He has, for example, been used for probing surface magnetism {Onellion1984}. In atom optics, He has found applications in nanolithography, as well as in atomic waveguides and beamsplitters for atom interferometry {Baldwin2005, Vassen2012}. He also serves as a source of polarized electrons {McCusker1969,McCusker1972} and ions {Schearer1969}, e.g., for atomic and high-energy nuclear scattering experiments. Besides that, spin-polarized samples of He(S) are used for biomedical imaging, e.g., to visualize the human lung {Walker1997, Kauczor1998, Nikolaou2015}.  Supersonic beams of He are typically produced by optical pumping {Happer1972}, as well as by magnetic (de-)focusing and magnetic deflection. Optical pumping of He(S) via the PS transition (where ) at a wavelength of  nm has first been achieved by Franken, Colegrove and Schaerer using a helium lamp {Franken1958, Colegrove1960, Schearer1961}. A few years later, also the optical pumping of the S level of the He isotope has been demonstrated using a similar setup {Phillips1962, Colegrove1963}. The more recent use of narrowband laser radiation has proven to be particularly efficient for the optical pumping of He {Giberson1982, Lynn1990, Wallace1995, Granitza1995}.  Apart from that, also the interaction of a spin with an inhomogeneous magnetic field has been used for producing spin-polarized atomic beams of He(S) and He(S), respectively. These level-preparation techniques include Stern-Gerlach deflection {Kato2012,Rubin2004,Zheng2017,Zheng2019,Chen2020,Smiciklas2010} , magnetic hexapole focusing {Jardine2001, Woestenenk2001, Watanabe2006, Chaustowski2007,Kurahashi2008,Kurahashi2021,Baum1988} and Zeeman deceleration {Dulitz2015a, Cremers2017b}.    A comparison between the different techniques for He preparation in a supersonic beam is of paramount importance for experimental design considerations. In this article, we describe the results of a comparative study aimed at the laser optical pumping of He(S) into a single  sub-level (where ) and at the magnetic hexapole focusing (defocusing) of the  () sub-level of He(S) using an array of two magnetic hexapoles. We have determined the efficiency for -sub-level selection using low-cost fluorescence and surface-ionization detectors, respectively, which can easily be implemented in other experiments.  {{sec:Setup}Experiments}  oindent Major parts of the experimental setup have already been described elsewhere {Grzesiak2019,Guan2019}. Briefly, a pulsed He beam is produced by a supersonic expansion of He gas from a high-pressure reservoir (bar) into the vacuum using a home-built CRUCS valve {Grzesiak2018} (s pulse duration). An electron-seeded plate discharge (attached to the front plate of the valve) is used to excite an  fraction of He atoms from the S electronic ground level to the two metastable levels, 2S and 2S, referred to as He hereafter {Grzesiak2019}. After passing through an mm-diameter skimmer at a distance of mm from the valve exit, the supersonic beam enters a second vacuum chamber, in which a specific magnetic sub-level of the 2S level is prepared using laser optical pumping or selected using magnetic hexapole focusing (see below). The distance between the skimmer tip and the center of the optical pumping region (hexapole magnets) is mm (mm). The He flux and the He beam velocity are determined using Faraday cup detection at well-known positions along the supersonic beam axis .   For the experiments on optical pumping, the pulsed valve is operated at room temperature resulting in a supersonic beam of He with a mean longitudinal velocity of m/s (m/s full width at half maximum, FWHM). For the experiments on magnetic hexapole focusing, the pulsed valve is cooled by a cryocooler (CTI Cryogenics, 350CP), and the valve temperature is actively stabilized to K using PID-controlled resistive heating. This results in a supersonic beam of He with a mean longitudinal velocity of m/s (m/s FWHM).  {{sec:setup.optPump} Laser optical pumping}  oindent The energy-level schemes and the experimental setup used for laser optical pumping are shown in Figs. ef{fig:Setup} (a) and (b), respectively. Optical pumping is achieved by laser excitation via the PS transition or via the PS transition at  1083 nm, respectively. The laser light for optical pumping is generated by a combination of a fiber laser and a fiber amplifier (NKT Photonics, Koheras BOOSTIK Y10 PM FM, W output power, kHz line width). The laser frequency is stabilized using frequency-modulated, saturated absorption spectroscopy in a He gas discharge cell. Since the frequency difference between the P and P spin-orbit levels is only GHz {NIST_ASD}, the laser frequency can be changed in between the different transitions without effort.  The laser light is guided to the vacuum chamber using a polarization-maintaining single-mode fiber, where it is collimated to a beam diameter of mm ( is the Gaussian beam waist). Before the laser beam enters the vacuum chamber, it passes a polarizing beam splitter for polarization clean-up, and a quarter wave plate for the production of circularly polarized light. Inside the vacuum chamber, the laser beam crosses the supersonic beam at right angles and parallel to the direction of the magnetic field produced by two coils in near-Helmholtz configuration (radius cm). The thus produced homogeneous magnetic field of  provides a uniform quantization axis for all He atoms in the supersonic beam.  The level-preparation efficiency is determined by measuring the laser induced-fluorescence (LIF) of the He atoms in the direction perpendicular to the supersonic beam and the laser beam. The fluorescence light is collected and focused onto an InGaAs photodiode (Hamamatsu, mm active area diameter, photosensivity of A/W at ) using two anti-reflection-coated, aspheric lenses (Thorlabs, mm diameter, mm focal length). Due to the symmetric lens configuration (as shown in Fig. ef{fig:Setup} (b)), the fluorescence collection region in the  plane is expected to be of the same size as the detection region, which is given by the active area of the photodiode. The output of the photodiode is amplified using a home-built transimpedance amplifier with a gain of . A rotatable linear polarizer (Thorlabs, extinction ratio  at ) is mounted in between the lenses in order to analyze the polarization of the fluorescence light. All the optical components of the fluorescence detector are placed into a single lens tube system to ensure the correct alignment of the optical parts. The entire detector assembly is positioned on a translational stage outside the vacuum chamber which can be moved along the  axis.  Under normal operating conditions, the number of He atoms in the S level is /pulse, as inferred from the signal on the Faraday-cup detector {Grzesiak2019}. For excitation via the PS transition, the time-dependent signal of the photodiode has a peak voltage of  and an FWHM of 27 s. The peak flux of detected photons is then inferred from  using {align}  {N}_{ ext{ph,max}} = {U_{ ext{PD,max}} }{h  u R_ ext{PD} G_{ ext{PD}}}  7  10^{11}{ ext{photons}}{ ext{s}}, {align} where  is Planck's constant and  is the corresponding transition frequency. From these measurements, we infer a root-mean-square noise amplitude of  for a single measurement which improves to  by averaging over 300 gas pulses. This results in a signal-to-noise ratio of  {align}  SNR = {U_{ ext{PD,max}}^2}{U_{ ext{noise}}^2} =  {cases}  16.2 ext{dB}   ext{single measurement}  40.3 ext{dB}   ext{300 averages}  {cases} {align} At , we thus infer a detection limit of photons/s (photons/s) for a single measurement (300 averages).   {figure}[hbt!]   {fig1.pdf}  {{fig:Setup}   (a) Left: He energy levels relevant for the experiments described in the main text.

Each hexapole array consists of 12 magnetized segments (Arnold Magnetic Technologies, NdFeB, N42SH, remanence of T) which are glued into an aluminium housing and placed on a position-adjustable rail at a center-to-center distance of mm.  To determine the focusing properties of the magnet assembly, a thin stainless-steel wire (diameter mm, labelled as ``W'' in Fig. ef{fig:Setup} (d)) is used as a position-sensitive Faraday-cup-type detector. Its position along the  and  axes can be varied by a maximum of mm and mm, respectively, using a set of two precision linear translators. A second Faraday-cup detector (labelled as ``FC'' in Fig. ef{fig:Setup} (d)), i.e., a stainless-steel plate of mm diameter, is placed behind the wire detector to determine the He beam velocity.   {Results and Discussion} {{sec:optPump} Laser optical pumping}  oindent In general, the level preparation efficiency relies on the polarization state of the laser radiation, on the energy-level structure of the involved electronic levels and on the transition strengths for photon absorption and emission. If atoms are excited with -polarized light, the change in angular momentum between the upper and lower level is  for every photon-scattering event, where  and  are the magnetic projection quantum numbers for the upper and the lower magnetic sub-levels, respectively. For excitation with -polarized light, .  The transition strengths for the PS transitions (where ) in He are shown in Fig. ef{fig:Setup} (a). As can be seen from the figure, all  transitions strengths for the PS transition are non-zero. Hence, in this case, multiple excitation cycles with -polarized light lead to equal populations in the 2S,  and 2P,  sub-levels, respectively. In this case, photon emission via this transition continues to occur as long as the atoms are subject to laser excitation. In contrast to that, the emission of photons ceases after a few pumping cycles for  excitation of the PS transition, since all population is trapped in the 2S,  sub-level. Likewise, the excitation of the PS transition using -polarized light leads to a transfer of population into the S sub-level and photon emission stops as a result of the zero transition strength for the PS transition.  As can be inferred from Fig. ef{fig:Setup} (a), the selective population of a single  sub-level in He(S) via the PS transition is more complicated, as it requires two different laser polarization states. Therefore, we have focused our experimental work on the optical pumping of He(S) via the PS and PS transitions, respectively. In the following, we provide a brief description of the different optical pumping schemes and the methods used for analyzing and optimizing the sub-level preparation efficiencies. Furthermore, we compare our results with literature values.  {{sec:optPumpAnalysis3P2} Optical pumping via the PS transition}  oindent As stated above, the excitation of the PS transition with -polarized light leads (after a few excitation cycles) to the optical cycling between the S,  sub-level and the 2P,  sub-level. In this case, the atomic fluorescence only consists of -polarized light as . During the first optical pumping cycles, and for a non-perfect circular polarization of the input light, also sub-levels with  are populated and can decay back to the S level while emitting - and -polarized photons as well. Therefore, the polarization purity of the emitted fluorescence provides information about the sub-level preparation efficiency. Since the polarization of fluorescence photons are given with respect to the quantization axis, which is the pointing of the external magnetic field vector, fluorescence photons of  polarization that are detected along an axis perpendicular to the quantization axis, are projected onto a linear polarization. The direction of this projected linear polarization is again perpendicular to the quantization axis. Furthermore, fluorescence photons of  polarization are linearly polarized parallel to the quantization axis. Therefore, we analyze the purity of the emitted light using a linear polarizer plate and the fluorescence intensity can be ascribed to  polarization ( polarization) if the transmission axis of the polarizer  is perpendicular (parallel) to the magnetic field component , respectively {Hubele2015}. For example, the results of fluorescence measurements at different polarizer angles are shown in Fig. ef{fig:P2FLmodulation}.  In order to compare the sub-level preparation efficiencies, we define {equation} _i = { ho(M_{J^{''}_i})}{_{i}{ ho(M_{J^{''}_i})}}, {equation} for producing a specific magnetic sub-level population  of He(2S) (where ). For the PS transition, the efficiency for optical pumping into the S sub-level is thus obtained using {align} _{+1(- 1)} = 1 - {I_{{F}}(P  B_z)}{I_{{F}}(P  B_z) + I_{{F}}(P  B_z)}, {align} where  and  are the fluorescence intensities for emission at polarizer axes  and , respectively. {figure}[hbt!]  [width=8cm]{fig2.eps    {{fig:P2FLmodulation} Fluorescence intensity as a function of polarizer angle for excitation with -polarized light via the PS transition. The experimental data points are shown as red circles. The black curve is a sine fit to the data. The dashed vertical lines represent the two angles at which the transmission axis of the polarizer  is perpendicular or parallel to the magnetic field component , respectively. Here, an efficiency of  is determined from the fit to the data.} {figure}  {{sec:optPumpAnalysis3P1} Optical pumping via the SP transition}  oindent Excitation via the PS transition allows for the selective optical pumping into each of the  sub-levels in He(S). When the atoms are excited with pure -polarized light, all population is pumped into the S sub-level. Since this is a dark sub-level, fluorescence emission should only occur in the first few pumping cycles. However, by using a mixture of - and -polarized excitation light, the dark sub-level is remixed, so that optical cycling (and thus fluorescence emission) continues to occur. In the present configuration, the input polarization is changed by varying the angle  of the quarter wave plate compared to the axis of the incident linear laser polarization. The observed change of the fluorescence intensity as a function of quarter wave plate angle is shown in Fig. ef{fig:P1FLmodulation}. The efficiency for pumping into the S sub-level is determined using {align} _{+1(- 1)} = 1 - {I_{ ext{F}}(^{+(-)})}{I_{ ext{F}}(^{+} + ^{-})}, {align} where  and  are the fluorescence intensities for excitation with pure  polarization and with a mixture of  and  polarization, respectively. {figure}[hbt!]  [width=8cm]{fig3.eps   {{fig:P1FLmodulation} Red circles: Measured fluorescence intensity for excitation via the PS transition as a function of quarter wave plate angle . The quarter wave plate angles for excitation with pure -polarized light and with an equal mixture of - and -polarized light are indicated as dashed vertical lines. The inset shows the results of a measurement in a region around  taken under different experimental conditions  } {figure}  For optical pumping into the S sub-level, we have used an additional coil pair in near-Helmholtz configuration (radius of mm, distance of mm), placed at right angles to the other Helmholtz-coil pair, to generate a well-defined quantization axis along the  direction. As a result, the laser beam direction is perpendicular to the magnetic field component . In addition to that, the quarter wave plate is replaced by a half wave plate. By rotating the half wave plate, the angle of polarization is adjusted to be either parallel or perpendicular to . In the latter case, the excitation light is projected onto an equal mixture of  and  input polarization which again causes a remixing of the otherwise dark sub-level S. Fig. ef{fig:P1M0FLmodulation} shows the change of the fluorescence intensity as a function of half wave plate angle. For pumping into the S sub-level, the sub-level preparation efficiency is thus obtained using {align} _{0} = 1 - {I_{ ext{F}}(  B_x)}{I_{ ext{F}}(  B_x)}, {align} where  and  are the fluorescence intensities for excitation using -polarized light in a direction parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field component , respectively. {figure}[hbt!]  [width=8cm]{fig4.eps   {{fig:P1M0FLmodulation} Red circles: Measured fluorescence intensity for excitation via the PS transition as a function of half wave plate angle . The half wave plate angles for excitation with -polarized light parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field direction  are indicated as dashed vertical lines.  } {figure}  {{sec:optPumpPosition} Optimization of the sub-level preparation efficiency}  oindent We have identified several parameters which strongly affect the sub-level preparation efficiency: the interaction time between the excitation laser light and the sample, the laser intensity, the magnetic field strength and the purity of the input polarization.  During the excitation process, an atom typically scatters several photons before it is pumped to the designated magnetic sub-level. Since the radiative lifetime of the 2P levels in He is long compared to typical optical pumping transitions in other atoms ( {NIST_ASD}), a comparably long interaction time between the laser beam and the sample has to be achieved. In our case, we have found that a large 1/ laser beam diameter of  is most practical for this purpose. For a supersonic beam with a mean velocity of m/s, this beam diameter translates into an interaction time of .  We have studied the influence of the interaction time on the sub-level preparation efficiency  by monitoring the fluorescence intensity at different fluorescence detector positions along the  axis. As can be seen from the colored markers in Fig. ef{fig:optPumpPosition}, the efficiency  for  excitation of the PS and PS transitions, respectively, increases to a nearly constant value as the detector is moved towards the midpoint of the excitation laser beam. This confirms that, in our experiment, the interaction time does not limit the sub-level preparation efficiency.   We have simulated the population transfer process using rate-equation calculations. A detailed description of the rate-equation model can be found in App.  ef{app:ratEqns}. The best fit to our experimental data for excitation via the PS transition and via the PS transition, respectively, is found by assuming that the excitation light is a mixture of  - and  -polarized light. The admixture of wrongly polarized light also explains why the observed sub-level preparation efficiency is below . In addition to that, as can be seen from Fig. ef{fig:Setup} (a), the relative transition strengths for optical pumping with wrongly polarized light is  for the PS transition, while it is only  for the PS transition. Thus, optical pumping via the PS transition is more sensitive to wrongly polarized excitation light which explains the observed difference in the sub-level preparation efficiency. In our setup, such an admixture of wrong input polarization might be caused by imperfections of the quarter wave plate or by the birefringence of the vacuum window. {figure}[hbt!]  [width=8cm]{fig5.eps   {{fig:optPumpPosition} sub-level preparation efficiencies  for  excitation of the PS and PS transitions (see legend), respectively, at different positions of the fluorescence detector along the  axis. The origin of the position axis denotes the midpoint of the laser beam.  Experimental values are shown as markers, and the results of the rate-equation calculations are shown as solid lines. In the calculations, a mixture of  - and  -polarized light is assumed for both excitation schemes.} {figure}  Secondly, the laser intensity has to be high enough so that the laser-induced power broadening compensates for a detuning of the laser frequency from the atomic resonance. This detuning is caused by the Doppler broadening due to the transverse velocity of the atoms ( FWHM) and by the Zeeman shift of the atomic levels (). The FWHM of the power broadening can be expressed as {align} _{ ext{power}} = {}{2 }  {1 + {I}{I_ ext{sat}}}, {align} where  is the intensity of the laser light and mW/cm (assuming a two-level system) is the saturation intensity of the transition. Therefore, in order to compensate for the Doppler broadening and for the Zeeman shift, the laser intensity has to be , corresponding to a laser power of  for our experiments. From Fig. ef{fig:optPumpPower}, we can see that the sub-level preparation efficiency for  excitation of the PS transition is constant for laser powers . Unfortunately, measurements of the sub-level preparation efficiency at lower laser powers suffer from low signal intensities and are thus less representative. For  excitation of the PS transition, we observe that more than 300 mW of laser power are required to reach a constant sub-level preparation efficiency. This power difference might be attributed to a weaker power broadening of the PS line compared to the PS line as a result of a higher saturation intensity for this transition. As both transitions have the same line width, the same initial level and approximately the same transition frequency, we can see from Eq. {eq:dmd} that the squared dipole matrix elements  are proportional to the degeneracy factors . As , it follows that PSPS. {figure}[hbt!]  {0.5cm}  [width=8cm]{fig6.eps   {{fig:optPumpPower} sub-level preparation efficiency  for  excitation of the PS and PS transitions (see legend), respectively, at different laser powers. The data are taken at a mm distance downstream from the midpoint of the laser beam in order to represent the efficiencies at equilibrium.} {figure}  Thirdly, the magnetic bias field has to be large enough to ensure a uniform quantization axis within the optical pumping region so that the contributions of stray fields along other spatial directions is small.   In Fig. ef{fig:optPumpBfiled}, a scan of the sub-level preparation efficiency  for  excitation of the PS and PS transitions, respectively, is shown as a function of the magnetic field component . The highest efficiency is achieved at field strengths between  for both transitions. This magnetic field range is in line with previous observations reported in the literature {Gillot2013,Wallace1995,Schearer1990a}. At magnetic field strengths , the sub-level preparation efficiency for excitation via the PS (PS) transition is decreased (remains constant) compared to the optimum  field range. This is consistent with a decreased scattering rate at higher magnetic fields caused by the increased Zeeman detuning.  {figure}[hbt!]  [width=8cm]{fig7.eps   {{fig:optPumpBfiled} sub-level preparation efficiency    for  excitation of the PS and PS transitions (see legend), respectively, at different bias magnetic field strengths. The data are taken at a mm distance downstream from the midpoint of the laser beam in order to represent the efficiencies at equilibrium.} {figure}  We have also analyzed the influence of stray magnetic fields along the  and  directions. Using a high-accuracy, three-axis Gauss probe (Stefan Mayer Instruments, , mG resolution), we obtain  and . At , this results in an angle of   between the magnetic field and the  axis (cf. Gillot et al. {Gillot2013}). We have observed that a further compensation of the magnetic stray fields using additional coils along the  axis (resulting in ) does not result in an improved sub-level preparation efficiency. In addition to that, a non-perfect alignment of the laser propagation direction parallel to the quantization axis can induce a similar limit to the achievable sub-level preparation efficiency as the presence of magnetic stray fields. Furthermore, small magnetic-field inhomogeneities within the interaction region, resulting from e.g. a not perfect Helmholtz coil arrangement or electronic devices in the laboratory, may also limit the sub-level-preparation efficiency.  In summary, we conclude that the imperfect polarization of the laser light (see discussion above) is the main limiting factor for the sub-level preparation efficiency.  {{sec:compOPlit} Comparison with literature values}  oindent In Tab. ef{tab:optPumpEfficiencies}, we present a summary of the maximum sub-level preparation efficiencies  obtained from our experimental data, and a comparison with literature values. As can be seen from the table, our  values are in good agreement with previous results for the laser optical pumping of He(S). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to obtain a maximum efficiency  for optical pumping into . The only previous attempt to selectively populate  has been by Giberson et al. {Giberson1982} using linearly polarized light resonant with the PS transition and propagating along the quantization axis.  For optical pumping into the spin-stretched sub-levels (), we report a somewhat lower maximum efficiency than previous groups which we attribute to the aforementioned imperfect laser polarization in our experiments. In addition, we see a deviation of  for optical pumping with  and -polarized light especially while exciting via the PS transition. This might be induced by a systematic asymmetry in our setup resulting from e.g. small magnetic-field inhomogeneities as discussed above. {table}[ht!]  {{tab:optPumpEfficiencies} Summary of maximum efficiencies  obtained for the laser optical pumping of He(S) into selected  sub-levels in our experiment, and comparison with literature values.

Figs. ef{fig:Setup} (c) and (d)). In order to interpret these results, we did numerical three-dimensional particle trajectory simulations in MATLAB. For these simulations, we use random number distributions for the particle positions and velocities (deduced from the experimental data obtained at the Faraday-cup detector) and a velocity-Verlet algorithm. An intial number of  particles in each Zeeman sub-level of He(S) and He(S) are propagated at a time. The magnetic field by the two Halbach arrays is implemented using the analytical expressions given in Ref.{Dulitz2016}. Particles are removed from the simulation if their transverse position inside a Halbach array exceeds the 3.0 mm inner radius of the assembly (cf. Fig. ef{fig:Setup} (c)).  In each  detection plane, the output of the trajectory simulation (black lines in Fig. ef{fig:Halbachres}) is analyzed over a certain interval of  positions corresponding to the diameter of the wire detector. The experimental results are matched to the simulated data by comparing the ratio of areas beneath two Gaussian distributions fitted to the datasets (not shown). Very good agreement between the experimental and simulated datasets is achieved by using an effective remanence of  and an effective wire diameter of  in the simulations. The decreased remanence compared to  could be due to the demagnetization of the material as a result of the prolonged storage time of the magnets. Likewise, deviations from the ideal Halbach configuration may also be possible as a result of manufacturing defects.   The analysis of the simulated results suggests that the strong increase of the He signal intensity around  is due to the transverse focusing of the  sub-level of the S level. The strongest signal increase, corresponding to the focal point of the device, is at a distance of mm from the center of the two Halbach arrays. The remaining signal intensity is mainly due to a mixture of He atoms in the S,  and S,  sub-levels. This is also consistent with previous observations {Watanabe2006}. At time , we assume a He(S)/He(S) ratio of  which is in line with the results of previous measurements in our laboratory {Guan2019}. At the focal point, the signal contribution by He atoms in the S,  sub-level is decreased by more than a factor of 7 compared to the signal intensity by atoms in the S,  sub-level. This is a result of the strong transverse magnetic defocusing forces which are exerted onto the atoms in the  sub-level.  The output of the simulation also provides an estimate of the sub-level selection efficiency for He(S, ), . Under the conditions of our experiment,  is nearly constant over a region of mm around the focal point. However, the efficiency strongly depends on the He beam diameter considered for the analysis. If we assume that the supersonic beam is collimated to the diameter of the wire detector (i.e., mm) just in front of this device, we obtain a maximum efficiency  at the focal point. If we assume the same He beam diameter as in the optical pumping experiments described above (i.e., mm), the maximum efficiency  at the focal point is reduced to . To further improve the sub-level selectivity, we suggest the use of a bent magnetic guide {Beardmore2009, Mazur2014, Osterwalder2015, Dulitz2016, Toscano2018} or by the use of a central stop behind the Halbach arrays  {Chaustowski2007,Kurahashi2008,Kurahashi2021,Baum1988}.  {figure}[hbt!]    [width=8cm]{fig8.pdf}  {{fig:Halbachres} Red circles: Measured He signal intensities on the wire detector at different positions  along the supersonic beam axis and at different transverse positions  after magnetic hexapole focusing.

We find that optical pumping into the spin-stretched sub-levels of He(2S) via the PS transition is more efficient than excitation via the PS transition. The best performance is achieved for  excitation via the PS transition yielding a maximum efficiency of  () for optical pumping into  ().  Magnetic hexapole focusing is observed to be highly sub-level selective at low forward velocities of the supersonic beam. At m/s and at the focal point of the hexapole lens system, we infer that up to  of the metastable atoms are in the  sub-level, if an mm-diameter region around the center of the supersonic beam axis is considered. The magnetic-hexapole-sub-level-selection technique is attractive, because it allows for the quantum-state manipulation of all atomic and molecular species with non-zero spin. Compared to optical pumping, the mechanical setup for magnetic focusing is rather simple, especially when commercial magnets are used {Osterwalder2015}.  However, optical pumping has several advantages compared to magnetic hexapole focusing. While magnetic focusing is limited to the preparation of sub-level-selected samples in low-field-seeking sub-levels only, optical pumping allows for the selective population of all  sub-levels, as shown here for the PS transition in He. For optical excitation with -polarized light, we obtain an efficiency of  for population transfer into . The creation of a pure  sub-level might be possible by using magnetic focusing as well but would require a strong overfocusing of the low-field seeking quantum states. In our experiments, this may be realized by further reducing the forward velocity of the He* atoms or by using a longer hexapole magnet array. However, we observe that the number of metastable helium atoms decreases by a factor of  when the valve temperature is decreased from K to K. At the same time, the peak He flux within the gas pulse decreases by a factor of , as the longer flight time to the detection region leads to a larger longitudinal spreading of the beam. Optical pumping can be applied independently of the velocity of the atoms as long as the discussed requirements for reaching the equilibrium sub-level efficiency are fulfilled. Thus, this technique results in a greater flexibility in choosing the valve temperature and, as mentioned above, running the valve at higher temperatures leads to much higher peak fluxes of -sub-level-selected atoms. These high peak fluxes are particularly important for applications which benefit from high local densities, such as collision experiments. Besides that, optical pumping relies on a transfer of population from a statistical mixture of  sub-levels into a single sub-level, whereas magnetic hexapole focusing relies on the spatial focusing (defocusing) of the desired (unwanted) -sub-level population. Further transmission losses are due to an aperture which has to be inserted into the beam path behind the magnet assembly in order to eliminate contributions by the S,  and S,  sub-levels, whose motion is not influenced by a magnetic field.  In the future, we will use the presented sources of -sub-level-selected He(2S) for quantum-state-controlled Penning-ionization studies {Grzesiak2019}. Furthermore, magnetic-sub-level-selected beams of He(2S) are useful as a starting point for the generation of coherent superposition states. The coherent control of Penning and associative ionization cross sections with such superposition states, for instance, involving the  sub-level of He(2S), has been predicted {Omiste2018}. In addition to that, helium is of particular interest for high-precision tests of few-electron quantum electrodynamics theory, as it is the simplest two-electron atom {Morton2006,Pachucki2017}. Accurate transition frequency measurements have been performed on ultracold trapped samples {vanRooij2011,Notermans2014,Rengelink2018} as well as on atomic beams {Pastor2004,Pastor2012,Zheng2017} of He(2S) atoms. The measurement of transitions with zero first-order Zeeman shift (i.e., S transitions) would greatly reduce the experimental uncertainty.  {acknowledgments}  oindent We thank J.

"{Introduction}   Online social media forums play a critical role in health-related information sharing~{record2018sought}.  Health experts have noted that they can help reduce healthcare inequalities and improve access to health care, for instance by empowering coalitions of people living with chronic illness or specific disabilities~{griffiths2012social}, or by providing an anonymous forum for people seeking emotional support~{de2014mental}. On the other hand, these forums elevate concerns about spreading medically inaccurate, misleading, or unsound information {dominguez2015pediatric,gage2018cancer}, which has had harmful public health impacts {poland2011age,nobles2019requests}. One study concluded that health information seekers in forums such as Reddit are likely to enact suggested behaviors regardless of perceived credibility {record2018sought}. However, the researchers also noted that this openness to information could be an opportunity for experts to encourage healthy behaviors through information sharing.  In this landscape, it is critical to understand the dynamics that cultivate safe communities that benefit the health and well-being of their participants and the broader implications for health communication {chou2009social}. Health experts are thus considering social media's role in their interactions with patients and broader public health issues, and their role in engaging with the platforms~{dominguez2015pediatric,nobles2019requests,nobles2020examining}. This motivates an important research direction: understanding how experts engage with users in online platforms. This can inform platform design, moderation decisions, and health promotion efforts by experts.  This work focuses on understanding the engagement with professionals in the domain of mental health with two main research questions: (RQ1) Do experts have distinct influences as compared to non-experts in their interactions with support-seekers in online mental health?; and (RQ2) Do the experts' behaviors reflect established counseling principles and findings regarding behaviors associated with positive counseling outcomes? To answer these questions, we analyze responses from self-identified mental health professionals (MHP) to support-seekers in mental health and support communities on Reddit, and compare them to responses from other users who we refer to as  extit{peers}. This is an important comparison, as many peers share similar health experiences, which prior work has found is associated with higher empathic concern~{hodges2010giving}.   First, we test whether a text classifier can distinguish between responses to support seekers from MHPs and peers. We find that it can, with 70 accuracy (well above random chance of 50). Second, we analyze comments leading to further engagement with the support-seeking posters, as existing counseling principles emphasize the importance of eliciting client engagement in expert counseling sessions~{miller2012motivational,perez2018analyzing}. Third, we analyze the users' linguistic tendencies, drawing inspiration from analyses of counseling conversations, which have offered insight into counselor behaviors associated with high quality sessions grounded in existing theories from psychology and counseling research using computational methods~{althoff2016large,perez2018analyzing,zhang2019finding,miller2012motivational}.  The main contributions of this work are: (1) We construct a dataset of mental health conversations from Reddit users with self-identified counseling expertise, covering a set of mental health subreddits annotated with categories denoting the type of mental health concern; (2) We develop a classifier that can distinguish between the language of MHPs and that of peers; (3) We perform an analysis of the differences in language use between MHPs and peers; and (4) We provide insight into language that leads to further engagement with support-seekers, comparing responses to peers and MHPs.    {Related Work}    {table*}[t]   {.24}{                           {tabular}{lr}              oprule             Subreddits & 77              Posts & 12,140              Poster Replies & 24,357              MHPs & 283              Peers & 56,701                           {2}{c}{Comments}                           MHP & 9,685              Peer & 92,698              Total & 102,383                           {2}{c}{Thread Length}                           Mean & 8.4              Median & 4              Max & 64                       {tabular}         {Dataset statistics.}         {tab:data_stats}     }          {.72}{                           {tabular}{ll}               oprule               extbf{Post:} & u/peeruserX                             {2}{p{0.9}}{I've recently been struggling with paranoid thoughts, for which I was hospitalized for my own safety.

This is particularly true for applications such as computer programming, career development, mentoring, coping with chronic or life-threatening diseases, and mental health issues~{baltadzhieva-chrupala-2015,Tomprou19,wang2015eliciting,de2014mental}.  In the mental health domain, studies have explored online support communities and many have found positive outcomes associated with anonymity, perceived empathy, and active user engagement~{de2014mental, rheingold1993virtual, hodges2010giving, welbourne2009supportive, nambisan2011information}. Computational approaches have aided studies in mental health forums, helping reveal positive relationships between linguistic accommodation and social support across subreddits~{sharma2018support}. One example of insights from this work is that topic-focused communities like subreddits may enable more peer-engagement than non-community based platforms~{sharma2020engagement}. Other studies have revealed certain trade-offs of online support platforms, such as disparities in the level of support offered toward support-seekers of various demographics~{wang2018s,nobles2020examining} and in condolences extended across different topics of distress~{zhou2020condolences}. Studying MHP behaviors in such scenarios might help develop approaches that balance these trade-offs.   Computational approaches applied in these forums have also shed light on population-level health trends and health information needs, with examinations into how depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affect different demographic strata~{amir2019mental}. Data mining has also been applied to understand adverse drug reactions~{wang2014sideeffectptm} and public reactions towards infectious diseases~{park2017tracking}. {nobles2018std} highlighted the potential for these forums to aid targeted health communication, for example by sharing information in r/STD, a subreddit about sexually transmitted diseases. Another case study of r/STD revealed the prevalence of diagnoses requests, and suggested that health professionals could partner with social media platforms to positively influence crowd-sourced diagnoses and help mitigate harmful misdiagnoses~{nobles2019requests}. {record2018sought} found that health information seeking Reddit users are likely to enact suggested behaviors regardless of perceived credibility, providing further reason for health expert engagement to intervene when harmful information sharing occurs and promote healthy behavior.    Fewer studies have analyzed expert interactions in online forums. A study in a large QA community found that experts are more likely to provide help than peers and that their participation in discussions resulted in increased length and substance of discussions~{Procaci17}. Recent studies have compared interactions with experts to interactions with peers in broader scientific communities~{park2020trust} and r/AskDocs on Reddit~{nobles2020examining}. The latter paper closely relates to our study, as they also consider posts from experts on Reddit, but solely within r/AskDocs about different health topics and with users of varying demographics.   The insights discussed above motivate investigations into how health experts and other users promote scientifically sound advice and offer supportive responses to health information seekers in online forums. In this work, we aim to contribute additional insights into expertise influence in online mental health communities by studying the dynamics of the communication process between support seekers and support providers.    {Data Collection}{sec:dataset}  We seek to understand the tendencies of users with professional experience, and more specifically counseling expertise, when interacting with support-seekers in online mental health and support-related forums. In uncovering which tendencies are associated with expertise, we enable further investigation into their role in the social dynamics of online support-seeking interactions, and potential applications of insight-driven recommendations for moderators and users of these forums.    {figure*}      {tikzpicture} {axis}[     width=,     height=3.5cm,     grid=both,     bar width=.25cm,     legend style={font=},     legend pos=north west,     symbolic x coords={health, tentat, work, anx, you, differ, discrep, they, foc.future, interrog, cogproc, quant, insight, risk, relig, assent, sad, motion, number, nonflu, we, ppron, time, leisure, ingest, family, body, home, anger, friend, filler, shehe, informal, foc.past, female, sexual, male, I, netspeak, swear},      xtick=data,     enlarge x limits=0.01,     x tick label style={rotate=60, anchor=east, font=},     ytick={0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0, 2.2},     y tick label style={anchor=east, font=}]     [ybar,fill=lightgray,ybar legend] coordinates  {      (health, 0.7959860332257565)      (tentat, 0.8055825728949596)      (work, 0.8110132828134121)      (anx, 0.8111684471647727)      (you, 0.8210292413944864)      (differ, 0.8553742434797355)      (discrep, 0.8692382037337468)      (they, 0.8751238940358339)      (foc.future, 0.8915196663317453)      (interrog, 0.8989293471898235)      (cogproc, 0.9000317012729139)      (quant, 0.9003896144608834)      (insight, 0.9057980632031888)      (risk, 0.9078690597633751)      (relig, 1.1016018716659848)      (assent, 1.1058051745294315)      (sad, 1.111442609622524)      (motion, 1.1147313092899014)      (number, 1.123251240900814)      (nonflu, 1.1346822371433698)      (we, 1.1514960646135939)      (ppron, 1.1743292153901252)      (time, 1.1760614995095569)      (leisure, 1.1907022197071266)      (ingest, 1.268569982423503)      (family, 1.3287365916478084)      (body, 1.332310541479952)      (home, 1.3387387079172697)      (anger, 1.352991457094508)      (friend, 1.4228051728743212)      (filler, 1.4910379699677137)      (shehe, 1.506362829049222)      (informal, 1.5087378339468138)      (foc.past, 1.519990107618276)      (female, 1.553857654748661)      (sexual, 1.575562715003554)      (male, 1.6370479733076038)      (I, 1.7324946157824643)      (netspeak, 1.8811274256235888)      (swear, 2.1973744687818817)     }; {Peers}     [ybar,fill=white,ybar legend] coordinates  {      (health, 0.7959860332257565)      (tentat, 0.8055825728949596)      (work, 0.8110132828134121)      (anx, 0.8111684471647727)      (you, 0.8210292413944864)      (differ, 0.8553742434797355)      (discrep, 0.8692382037337468)      (they, 0.8751238940358339)      (foc.future, 0.8915196663317453)      (interrog, 0.8989293471898235)      (cogproc, 0.9000317012729139)      (quant, 0.9003896144608834)      (insight, 0.9057980632031888)      (risk, 0.9078690597633751)     }; {MHPs}     [draw=blue,ultra thick,smooth]      coordinates {(health, 1)(tentat, 1)(work, 1)(anx, 1)(you, 1)(differ, 1)(discrep, 1)(they, 1)(foc.future, 1)(interrog, 1)(cogproc, 1)(quant, 1)(insight, 1)(risk, 1)(relig, 1)(assent, 1)(sad, 1)(motion, 1)(number, 1)(nonflu, 1)(we, 1)(ppron, 1)(time, 1)(leisure, 1)(ingest, 1)(family, 1)(body, 1)(home, 1)(anger, 1)(friend, 1)(filler, 1)(shehe, 1)(informal, 1)(foc.past, 1)(female, 1)(sexual, 1)(male, 1)(I, 1)(netspeak, 1)(swear, 1)};     {axis}      ode[align=center,rotate=90,font=] at (-1.15cm, 0.9cm) {Dominance};      ode[align=center,rotate=90,font=] at (-0.8cm, 0.9cm) {(peer/MHP)};     {tikzpicture}     {LIWC category dominance scores, computed as the relative use by peers divided by the relative use by MHPs, so that equal use is at  (blue line), higher dominance by peers at  (grey bars) and higher dominance by MHPs at  (white bars).

In addition, Reddit has a system that allows users to indicate their professional expertise (Reddit Flairs), which we use to identify a set of users with mental health professional background, identified as  extit{MHPs} during our study. We obtained flairs from the r/psychotherapy subreddit,{{https://old.reddit.com/r/psychotherapy/wiki/acronymswiki_degrees_and_licenses}{Degree and license flair descriptions from r/psychotherapy wiki.}} a decision motivated by their reliability, as the moderators of this community allow comments and posts only by licensed therapy providers who may be asked to submit proof if concerns of falsely posing as a therapist arise.{See rule 2 and 9 in {https://www.reddit.com/r/psychotherapy/}, also listed in Appendix~ ef{sec:appendix_flairs}.} Sample flair tags in this set are: Psychiatrist (sometimes accompanied by MD or DO), LPC (or Licensed Professional Counselor), LMFT (or Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist), PsyD (or Doctorate of Psychology).  We use an existing list of mental health subreddits from r/ListOfSubreddits{{https://www.reddit.com/r/ListOfSubreddits/comments/dmic6o/advice_mental_health_subreddits/}{r/ListOfSubreddit's compilation of mental health and advice subreddits.}} with additions from manual observations; all of the subreddits in our dataset with their number of comments are in Appendix~ ef{sec:appendix_datacollection} in Table~ ef{tab:appendix_subbreddits_and_comments}. From these, we retrieve threads where an MHP submitted a direct reply. During this step, we also kept posts made by peers i.e., individuals who did not use any of the mental health care professional flairs. Our collection spans threads created between November 29, 2009 and December 21, 2020. Table~ ef{tab:data_stats} shows descriptive statistics for the final composition of the dataset, and  Table~ ef{tab:data_sample4} shows a sample interaction demonstrating the structure we use for our analysis. This study focuses on direct replies to the poster, thus we attempt to eliminate  extit{megathreads} which tend not to focus in individual support-seekers by removing those above the 95th percentile in their number of direct replies; we leave analysis of deeper nested replies for future work.     {table}[t]               {tabular}{ll}   oprule Key & Topic   Trauma & Trauma  Abuse  Anx & Psychosis  Anxiety  Compuls. & Compulsive Disorders  Cope & Coping  Therapy  Mood & Mood Disorders  Addict. & Addiction  Impulse Control  Body & Eating  Body   Neurodiv. & Neurodevelopmental Disorders   Health & General  Social & Broad Social       {tabular}     {Health condition and other subreddit topics. Keys are shortened names we use to refer to the topics.}     {tab:subreddit_health_categories} {table}  {Health Topics.} To understand whether particular topics influence interactions with support-seekers, we group the subreddits into broader topics based on related health domains. We begin by following the categorization of subreddits by {sharma2018support}, who used the -means clustering algorithm to generate initial clusters on the -grams  of the posts and manually refined the categories based the community descriptions in their subreddit home pages. Next, we adjust the categories and their associated subreddits based on the World Health Organization's ICD-10 classification system of mental and behavioural disorders.{{https://www.who.int/substance_abuse/terminology/icd_10/en/}} The resulting topic categories are listed in Table~ ef{tab:subreddit_health_categories} alongside shortened names which we use to refer to them. The full list of subreddits assigned to each topic are listed in Appendix~ ef{sec:appendix_datacollection} in Table~ ef{tab:appendix_subreddit_categories}.    {Distinguishing MHPs and Peers}{sec:classification}  To begin our investigation into the linguistic behaviors of MHPs and peers, we test whether simple text classifiers are able to distinguish between comments authored by either MHPs or peers. We build three classifiers with different feature sets; the first are unigram counts for unigrams occurring at least five times, the second includes counts for the 73 word classes in the LIWC (Linguistic Inquire and Word Count) lexicon~{pennebakerlinguistic}, and the third encodes a subset of LIWC word classes associated with perspective shifts (i.e.,  extit{focusfuture, focuspast, focuspresent, I, ipron, negemo, posemo, ppron, pronoun, shehe, they, we,} and  extit{you})~{althoff2016large}; we elaborate on the psychological meaning behind these features in our analyses in the next section.   Due to the class imbalance between the peer and MHPs classes, we first downsampled the peer class to get a balanced distribution with the MHP class. This resulted in a set of 9,685 instances per class. We conduct our evaluations using ten-fold cross validation. Across these folds, the number of features ranges from 8,668 to 8,703. We use a Naive Bayes model, implemented with Sklearn’s MultinomialNB module,~{{https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB.html}} which outperformed a logistic regression model and an SVM in preliminary experiments.{Runs in 40 seconds per fold on one AMD Ryzen 7 3700U CPU.}    All models outperform a random baseline{ using a permutation test~{dror-etal-2018-hitchhikers2}} with all LIWC features bringing the accuracy to 59.12, LIWC perspective features to 59.14, and unigram features to 70.80. Overall, the classification results indicate language differences exist between the MHPs and peers. Motivated by this result, we proceed to several analyses to gain insights.  {Linguistic and Dialogue Analysis}{sec:ling_and_dialog}  We analyze the linguistic behaviors of MHPs and peers responding to support-seeking posts, and their potential influence in eliciting further engagement with the support-seeker. Our analyses are inspired by psychology and computational studies that have shown that conversational behavioral aspects such as word usage, client engagement, and language matching are positively related to successful counseling interactions~{gonzales2010language,althoff2016large,perez2018analyzing,zhang2019finding}.     {figure}[t]      {tikzpicture} {axis}[     width=8.25cm,     height=3cm,     grid=both,     symbolic x coords={Disgust, Surprise, Anger, Fear, Sadness, Joy},     xtick=data,     x tick label style={rotate=0, font=},      ytick={0.9, 1.1, 1.3, 1.5, 1.7},     y tick label style={anchor=east, font=}]     [ybar,fill=lightgray] coordinates  {      (Disgust, 1.71028997750357)      (Surprise, 1.3983259978898)      (Anger, 1.14086998542706)      (Fear, 1.06922731579117)      (Sadness, 1.06749537047073)      (Joy, 1.00660420378226)     };  {axis}  ode[align=center,rotate=90,font=] at (-0.8cm, 0.7cm) {Dominance}; {tikzpicture}     {WordNet Affect usage (peers / MHPs)}     {fig:wordnet_affect} {figure}  {Linguistic Ethnography}{sec:linguistic_ethno}   Numerous studies have demonstrated relationships between the dominant usage of certain word categories with  individuals' psychological and physical health~{tausczik2010psychological,weintraub1981verbal,rude2004language}.  In alignment with these studies, we investigate the usage of such word categories using the LIWC and WordNet-Affect lexicons~{pennebakerlinguistic,wordnet-affect}.  For each group of users, we first compute the proportion of their words that fall in each category. Then, we compute the dominant use by dividing the proportion for peer users over the proportion for MHPs~{mihalcea2009linguistic}. Figure~ ef{fig:liwc} shows  LIWC categories where the rate of use differs by at least 10, and results for WordNet Affect categories are shown in Figure~ ef{fig:wordnet_affect}.  Some observations such as the higher dominance of swear words ( extit{swear}) and internet speak ( extit{netspeak}) might be expected if professionals avoid such language. An interesting contrast in peers' language is the dominant use of first-person pronouns ( extit{I, we}) and focus on the past ( extit{focuspast}). In contrast, MHPs seem to use more non-first person pronouns ( extit{you, they}) and focus on the future ( extit{focusfuture}) instead.  Peers' use of first person pronouns might arise when they share similar experiences with support-seekers. MHPs' use of second-person pronouns might suggest they are focusing on the support-seekers' experiences as a counselor would with a client in a counseling encounter. We also observe higher dominance of all WordNet Affect categories among peers, however the  extit{joy} category (the most positive), is nearly equal with MHPs.   These observations of the peers' language are compelling because they align with existing theories linking depression to negative views of the future (i.e.,  extit{focuspast} and negative WordNet affects)~{pyszczynski1987depression} and self-focusing style (i.e., first-person pronouns)~{pyszczynski1987self,campbell2003secret}. Likewise, clients of SMS-based crisis counseling conversations were more likely to report feeling better after the encounter if they exhibited perspective shifts from these categories to their counterparts (i.e., toward  extit{focusfuture}, non-first person pronouns, and positive sentiment)~{althoff2016large}.  Interestingly, the same study found clients were more likely to shift perspective when their counselors exhibited use of the counterpart categories first, suggesting that the counselors may play a key role in helping drive the perspective shift. Given those positive outcomes, observing the same dominant linguistic aspects among MHPs is encouraging and potentially signals a connection between how counselors apply conversational behaviors in practice and in online forum interactions. Future work can investigate the progression of dialogue between MHPs and support-seekers to find if support-seekers similarly exhibit the perspective shifts associated with the positive outcomes of the prior study, and likewise whether users of the forums also experience positive outcomes where this occurs.   {figure*}[t]    {.53}{                           {tikzpicture} {axis}[     width=1.1,     height=3.7cm,     grid=both,     symbolic x coords={filler, health, body, bio, cause, tentat, you, affect, time, nonflu, certain, netspeak, hear, affiliation, foc.past, female, number, shehe, friend, leisure, male, ingest, anger, feel, sexual, informal, i, swear, assent, relig},     xtick=data,     enlarge x limits=0.01,     bar width=.15cm,     x tick label style={rotate=60, anchor=east, font=},     ytick={0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3},     y tick label style={anchor=east, font=}]     [ybar,fill=white] coordinates  {         (filler, 1.3694959488399698)         (health, 1.2199518622464156)         (body, 1.1963945578342048)         (bio, 1.1361700435532724)         (cause, 1.0795619328576351)         (tentat, 1.0684715763913766)         (you, 1.0647948805231773)         (affect, 0.952284583106825)         (time, 0.9517636175949772)         (nonflu, 0.9511736159516474)         (certain, 0.9483112140262707)         (netspeak, 0.9463188721091061)         (hear, 0.9389897621251143)         (affiliation, 0.9356603838607868)         (foc.past, 0.932086788032833)         (female, 0.9316496264858395)         (number, 0.9205180739190895)         (shehe, 0.9183051123944717)         (friend, 0.8982679230950917)         (leisure, 0.8969320017601914)         (male, 0.890290971657498)         (ingest, 0.8876147841875732)         (anger, 0.8792607168321827)         (feel, 0.8702617564065401)         (sexual, 0.8668272078839886)         (informal, 0.8624389844393203)         (i, 0.8066956501832807)         (swear, 0.7870234652664857)         (assent, 0.7822245598953113)         (relig, 0.6755071110674885)     };

Figure~ ef{fig:engagement_dominance} shows these ratios for categories that differ by at least 5. A compelling observation is the dominance of the categories  extit{health},  extit{tentat}, and  extit{you} in the MHP comments prompting poster-replies, and  extit{you},  extit{focusfuture},  extit{interrog}, and  extit{health} in the peer comments prompting poster-replies, as was exhibited among MHPs (see Figure~ ef{fig:liwc} in Section~ ef{sec:linguistic_ethno}); on the other end, the categories are more dominant in comments that do not engage a reply such as  extit{I},  extit{we},  extit{death},  extit{friend},  extit{relig},  extit{swear}, were similarly represented as dominant categories in the peer group.  To gain further insight into these observations, we perform the following analysis: for each user group (peers and MHPs) we use a foreground corpus of their comments that were replied to by the support-seekers, and a background corpus of their comments that were not, and compute the dominance of LIWC categories of the foreground over the background as a ratio of their relative frequencies.  We then rank the categories by highest to lowest dominance scores, and refer to this ranking by  exttt{DRR} (for  extbf{D}ominance  extbf{R}ank for  extbf{R}eplied comments). We compare the  exttt{DRR}s of each user group to the ranking of LIWC category usage among MHP users and among peer users separately (from Section~ ef{sec:linguistic_ethno}) by computing the Kendall Tau's coefficient between them. A positive correlation would thus indicate that the more (or less) dominant categories among a group's replied comments are also more (or less) dominant among the other group overall. The correlation coefficients are shown in Table~ ef{tab:ranked_comparison}.  {table}               {tabular}{llrr}          oprule          exttt{DRR} Group & OR Group &   & p-value                   Peer & MHP & .191 & .017          MHP & MHP & .158 & .048          Peer & Peer & -.031 & .689          MHP & Peer & .008 & .916               {tabular}     {Kendall 's coefficient between the LIWC category dominance ranking in the replied comments ( exttt{DRR}) of the user group on the left and the overall ranking of LIWC category usage ( exttt{OR}) by the user group to the right.     }     {tab:ranked_comparison} {table}  Interestingly, we observe a slight positive correlation between the  exttt{DRR}s for both MHPs and peers with the overall LIWC category usage ranking for MHPs. On the other hand, we see no correlations with the LIWC usage ranks for peers. Intuitively, it appears that for both MHPs and peers, the comments prompting further engagement with the poster appear to reflect the overall dominant linguistic aspects captured by LIWC of MHPs, but not peers. As counseling principles have emphasized the importance of mutual engagement between counselors and clients~{miller2012motivational} and other work has shown that higher quality counseling sessions are associated with higher client engagement~{perez2018analyzing}, it is compelling to observe associations between linguistic aspects of MHPs with the aspects associated with poster-engagement.    {Linguistic Style Matching}{sec:lsm}  Linguistic Style Matching (LSM) measures the extent to which one speaker matches another~{gonzales2010language}. It compares two parties' relative use of function words as these words are more indicative of style rather than content~{ireland2010language}.  Previous studies in counseling conversations have measured LSM to understand the extent that counselors and clients match their language. {perez2019makes} showed higher LSM for high quality counseling sessions whereas {althoff2016large} showed lower LSM for higher quality sessions. {perez2019makes} attributed this to the differences between the conversations they analyzed, theirs being synchronous face-to-face interactions while {althoff2016large}'s was of asynchronous text messages, as well as differences in counseling styles.  We follow {nobles2020examining}'s approach leveraging {ireland2010language}'s procedure to measure LSM between support seekers and support providers.  {figure*}            {tikzpicture}       {axis}[       width  = -2cm,       height = 3cm,       ybar=2*,       ylabel={LSM Score},       ylabel style={font=},       ymajorgrids = true,       symbolic x coords={Trauma,Anx,Compuls.,Cope,Mood,Addict.,Body,Neurodiv.,Health,Social,All},       x tick label style={rotate=0, font=},       xtick = data,       scaled y ticks = false,       ymin=0.4,       legend cell align=left,     legend style={at={(1.01,0.4)},anchor=west}       ]       [style={fill=white},error bars/.cd, y dir=both, y explicit]           coordinates { (Trauma,0.6310119156541756) += (0,0.029962442897110475) -= (0,0.03081514525447937) (Anx,0.5997199013986588) += (0,0.01519174511662591) -= (0,0.015544352706185927) (Compuls.,0.6281754095486042) += (0,0.0357519342555046) -= (0,0.03738872492676926) (Cope,0.6473266495067116) += (0,0.010066984978184701) -= (0,0.010552935538052588) (Mood,0.6437280427655686) += (0,0.009180262091117664) -= (0,0.009328442085683064) (Addict.,0.5709948285212645) += (0,0.015199256087097268) -= (0,0.015134390184438407) (Body,0.5887944659204036) += (0,0.04432956318398418) -= (0,0.04696878984370534) (Neurodiv.,0.6309063259324916) += (0,0.01391890784736749) -= (0,0.014303173962970095) (Health,0.6144863767231595) += (0,0.007425543475062746) -= (0,0.007746525814329885) (Social,0.5060244756989379) += (0,0.00862992954522357) -= (0,0.00859438033560228) (All,0.5887940258624854) += (0,0.004103442535799973) -= (0,0.0041157209528478456)           };       [style={fill=lightgray},error bars/.cd, y dir=both, y explicit,error bar style=black]            coordinates { (Trauma,0.6378865787475075) += (0,0.0119576476105826) -= (0,0.012096314353275406) (Anx,0.5922057266084959) += (0,0.004617719809004162) -= (0,0.004731922540469169) (Compuls.,0.5856424758280658) += (0,0.017818249302948175) -= (0,0.017936496148185377) (Cope,0.5887105654136473) += (0,0.0045978888128952455) -= (0,0.004486067568766683) (Mood,0.6105143832329811) += (0,0.004169661426287274) -= (0,0.004238386512265935) (Addict.,0.5408042001923349) += (0,0.0038984385211480177) -= (0,0.00395860140679527) (Body,0.6155639543382515) += (0,0.01529421389797847) -= (0,0.01587817947763348) (Neurodiv.,0.5992797132344616) += (0,0.0036899641469281264) -= (0,0.0036385952314014203) (Health,0.6089407444992813) += (0,0.0027053359645056174) -= (0,0.002665433221403779) (Social,0.6184805035707305) += (0,0.002843520445438563) -= (0,0.0028728095634809048) (All,0.5969832369722273) += (0,0.0013587580377160124) -= (0,0.0013578362432092872)           };       {MHPs, peers}   {axis}   {tikzpicture}  {LSM scores with 95 confidence intervals calculated with non-parametric bootstrap resampling.}  {fig:lsm} {figure*} For a text sequence, we compute the percentage of words that belong to each of nine function-word categories  from the LIWC lexicon, which include  extit{auxiliary verbs, articles, common adverbs, personal/impersonal pronouns, prepositions, negations, conjunctions,} and  extit{quantifiers}. Then, we compute the LSM of each word category  as shown in Equation  ef{eq:lsm} where  represents  extit{post} and  represents the response. The composite LSM score for  and  is the mean of all category LSM scores. For each thread, we separate the MHP and peer replies, and take the mean of all composite LSM scores.   {equation}{eq:lsm}     LSM_c = 1 - {abs(cat_p - cat_r)}{cat_p + cat_r + .0001} {equation}  We compute these LSM scores over all data together as well as separately for each subreddit topic (named in Table~ ef{tab:subreddit_health_categories}). The resulting scores are shown in Figure~ ef{fig:lsm}.   We observe LSM scores vary by topic, and most are similar for peers and MHPs or have overlapping confidence intervals. Compared to their LSMs in other topics, MHPs score lower in { Social}, which covers broad social issues that are less specialized to health conditions than the others. However, peers have high LSMs in { Social} relative to most other topics, and notably higher LSMs than the MHPs. Additionally, MHPs have higher LSMs than those of peers and relative to their own in communities that cover topics of specific compulsive, mood, and neurodevelopmental disorders ({ Compuls., Mood,} and { Neurodiv.}), communities that orient toward counseling purposes ({ Cope}), or toward advice-seeking communities for health and social concerns ({ Health}). The influences in these results require further investigation, but a possible explanation could be that expert knowledge and experience may offer more benefit to specialized condition-related issues than to broader social issues.     {Language Modeling}  We further examine differences in word usage by building separate language models for MHPs and peers. We seek to identify language use that is indicative of one group or another by running the language model of one on the data of the other and analyzing words with high perplexity. To run these experiments, we use the language model of {merity2018analysis,merity2018regularizing}, which is a recent LSTM-based language model that achieved state-of-the-art performance by combining several regularization techniques.{{htts://github.com/salesforce/awd-lstm-lm}}  Our implementation uses a fixed vocabulary of 20,907 tokens for both the peer and MHP language models. This is determined by a minimum count of five across the set of posts from both groups.

High entropy scores on one dataset indicate word types that are harder for the opposite group's model to predict.}     {fig:ent_diff_charts} {figure*}  We use the language model trained on MHP data to find words with high entropy in peer data and vice versa. Since we are concerned with the  extit{difference} in predictability of words between the MHP and peer language models, we subtract the entropy given by the model trained on that data from the entropy assigned by the model that was not trained on that data. In other words, to find words difficult to predict in B's data, we subtract each word's entropy calculated by the model trained on B from the entropy calculated by the model trained on A as follows, for a set of words, X:   {equation}     E_{A,B} = -{1}{ X } _{x  X} log(p_{A}(x)) - log(p_{B}(x)) {equation}  If we calculate the entropy difference for each LIWC category and for each assignment of the MHP and peer groups to A and B, we find the highest differences for each category shown in the first and third plots of Figure~ ef{fig:ent_diff_charts}. We find highest entropy scores for words relating to  extit{leisure},  extit{sex}, and  extit{numbers} when running the MHP language model on peer data. Likewise, when running the peer model on MHP data, the category of  extit{discrepancy} contains words whose accuracy is improved the least by the peer model, again showing that these words are more indicative of the MHP group.  We perform a similar analysis, creating a language model for posts which have the highest score (or tied for highest) and another model for all other posts. We measure entropy differences and show the highest scoring categories for each group in the second and fourth plots. Some of the categories indicative of MHP language are also indicative of higher scoring posts;  extit{discrepancy},  extit{present} and  extit{future} words, and  extit{negation} words, while other categories like  extit{assent} and  extit{insight} words are more dominant in higher scoring posts. The lower scoring posts have the highest entropy differences for some types of words in the peer data, however, we also see that  extit{filler},  extit{anger}, and  extit{swear} words had the highest entropy differences for the low scoring group. Qualitative example sentences with word-level entropy and LIWC annotations are shown in the appendix in Table~ ef{tab:examples_mhp_data}.   {Discussion and Future Work}   In comparing linguistic aspects of MHP and peer comments, we find MHP tendencies align with established counseling principles and findings in counselor behaviors from recent literature. In particular, they align in the use of words that increase the likelihood of desired perspective shifts associated with clients feeling better after text counseling sessions (RQ2)~{althoff2016large}. We also found unique differences in the behavior of MHPs as compared to peers in how they respond to information seekers (RQ1). Although, comments by peers that prompt support-seeker replies also make use of similar word categories to MHPs, which shows that comparing MHPs to peers can offer insight into peer interactions as well.  It is important to note that our analyses rely heavily on the LIWC lexicon. While LIWC and other lexicons can help uncover variational language across groups at an exploratory stage, their use alone does not explain why variations are present. Certain limitations of LIWC are clear, such as when certain words that occur in multiple categories misleadingly boost the prominence of the categories equally. {kross2019does}'s and {jaidka2020estimating}'s studies have also demonstrated limitations of the use of LIWC when working with word counts to correlate with well-being metrics and an individual’s emotional state. We utilize LIWC to understand linguistic behavior differences in conversations with peers and MHPs rather than to evaluate the emotional or mental health state of individuals; however, it is important to consider how these limitations could pertain to our interpretations of their differences, especially as we explore them more deeply in future work. In our study, we explore the patterns we find in the context of previous findings from related literature such as {althoff2016large} and {nobles2020examining}, however it warrants another study into nuanced aspects of the patterns to infer their social functions in support seeking forums in particular.  Although our findings align MHP behaviors with certain counselor behaviors associated with positive outcomes, our analyses do not support claims that MHP behaviors are more beneficial to individuals seeking support; rather, we have shown that the general tendencies of MHPs are in accordance with principles and behaviors demonstrated by counselors in other settings. Understanding the outcomes of these interactions for individual support seekers remains as an area for future work, which could employ surveying methods from prior work to  measure perceived empathy in online communities~{nambisan2011information}. Our dataset also enables investigations into whether support-seekers exhibit perspective shifts in interacting with MHPs or peers, and what MHP and peer tendencies are associated with these perspective shifts.  Another direction for future work could focus on modeling social media-specific engagement patterns of MHP and peer interactions. Prior work developed a model that accounts for variables indicating the level of attention threads receive (i.e., thread lengths and number of unique commenters), and variables indicating the degree of interaction between posters and commenters (i.e., time between responses and whether the poster replies to commenters), and used this model to study peer-to-peer interactions in online mental health platforms~{sharma2020engagement}; this approach may enable studying supportive interactions in megathreads and threads involving back-and-forth dialog between two or more parties.  More questions arise if we consider MHP tenure and specific domain of expertise (e.g., specializations, licenses, academic degrees). Prior work that studied longitudinal changes in counselor linguistic behaviors indicated that systematic changes occur over time as counselors develop personal styles that are more distinct from other counselors and exhibit more diversity across interactions~{zhang2019finding}. Future work could model the language longitudinally for MHPs and peers that have longer-term histories of participating in mental health forums to investigate whether systematic changes occur online as well, and if so, whether they reflect similar changes found in prior work.       {Limitations and Ethical Considerations}   A number of unknowns exist in what we are able to extract from Reddit. For instance, we do not know if users that do not use flairs are mental health professionals. We assume that those who have used the MHP flairs are MHPs and those that have not used them are peers. Additionally, we have grouped all MHP flairs into one group for our analysis, though a more nuanced analysis based on particular professional roles (e.g., psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers) and specializations (e.g., motivational interviewing, cognitive behavioral therapy, family  marriage counseling) may reveal additional trends. Prior work found that disclosing credentials has impacts on engagements that vary by subreddit and linguistic patterns associated with different experience levels and expert domains~{park2020trust}, thus the effects of disclosing MHP credentials when responding to support-seekers should be investigated.  A classifier or language model used to distinguish between MHPs and peers or to generate the language of either could have negative implications. A generative model that provides feedback to users could generate language that is harmful for those seeking help. Our work could be used to devise a tool to train counselors, however we do not have a direct measure of what type of responses are helpful or meaningful. In such an application, there is potential to reinforce harmful behaviors due to the inaccuracy of our models. Future studies are needed to determine how to best design a tool to train counselors and how models derived from corpora such as ours correspond to advice that patients find useful.   {Conclusion}  As the role of social networks is becoming more critical in how people seek health-information, it is important to understand their broader implications to health communication and how health experts can engage to promote the soundest information and offer support to their vulnerable users. By elucidating techniques employed by mental health professionals in their interactions with support-seekers in mental health forums, we have contributed insights toward the broader research direction of understanding how health experts currently engage with these platforms. With evidence that MHP linguistic behaviors associate with further engagement with support-seekers and that these same behaviors are associated with positive counseling conversation outcomes, we have shown that analyzing MHP behavior is a promising direction for better understanding online interaction outcomes, which can further inform forum design and moderation, and expert health promotion efforts.
